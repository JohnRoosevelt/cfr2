[{"n":"Foreword","ps":[{"t":2,"p":0,"c":"Foreword"},{"t":7,"p":1,"c":"　　The general theme of this book is the great controversy between Christ and Satan. Every person is involved in it. Ellen White was personally reminded of this when she suffered a stroke of paralysis at the age of 30 as she was about to write out her first account of the vision she had been given at Lovett’s Grove, Ohio, in March 1858. The Lord told her that the paralysis was an attempt by Satan to kill her so she could not write what she had seen. The little book of 219 pages that she produced that year, based on this vision, is Spiritual Gifts, Volume 1, which today can be found as a part of Early Writings. This marked the beginning of a lifetime of writing on the controversy theme that was to continue to the last year of her life as she completed Prophets and Kings. {CTr 5.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　The great controversy theme is well covered in the five books of the Conflict of the Ages series. This devotional book complements these major works. It begins where the great controversy began—with Lucifer in heaven. It traces that controversy through to the end. The entry for January 1 comes from the first page of Patriarchs and Prophets, and the last entry, for December 31, is found in the last pages of The Great Controversy. It is interesting to note that the first and last phrases are identical: “God is Love.” {CTr 5.2}"},{"t":7,"p":3,"c":"　　Nearly 90 percent of this book has been drawn from Ellen White’s letters, sermons, and manuscripts. Portions of these materials will be familiar to frequent readers of her books, as some extracts have been used in the many compilations prepared since her death. These compilations include devotional books that have been published during the past 50 years. Other materials can be found in Manuscript Releases, Volumes 1 to 21, and in Sermons and Talks, Volumes 1 and 2. {CTr 5.3}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　In general, the text for each day’s devotional study has been taken from the King James Version of the Bible. This was the version most used by Ellen White, though occasionally she used others. {CTr 5.4}"},{"t":7,"p":5,"c":"　　The prophets whom God inspired to write the books of the Bible used the languages of their day—Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. But these languages were not understood by all, hence translations were needed. To make the Old Testament available to people unacquainted with Hebrew and Aramaic, Jewish scholars several centuries before the time of Christ produced a Greek version known as the Septuagint. From this beginning the Scriptures have been translated into more than a thousand languages. And beyond that, numerous versions have been produced in a single language. Among the English language versions the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) uses gender-inclusive language without in any way changing the meaning of the text. A few of the scripture texts for the daily devotionals in this book have been selected from this version. {CTr 5.5}"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　Like the Bible writers, Ellen White used the language of her day. However, writing styles change, as do meanings of words. Thus, when the Comprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White was published in 1963, a “Glossary of Obsolete and Little Used Words and Terms with Altered Meanings” was included at the end of Volume 3. The purpose was to help readers understand better what Mrs. White was saying. In her time, words such as “he,” “man,” “men,” and “mankind” were accepted as generic terms that included both men and women. Today this is not so common. Thus, without making any change in Mrs. White’s thought, this devotional book uses gender-inclusive language. {CTr 6.1}"},{"t":7,"p":7,"c":"　　As an example, note the February 12 reading: “The difference between a good person and a wicked person is not always caused by natural goodness of disposition.” The original reads: “The difference between a good man and a wicked man is not always caused by natural goodness of disposition.” In the February 3 reading, note the line that begins: “As the years of human beings have decreased, and their physical strength has diminished, so their mental capacities have lessened.” The original reads: “As the years of man have decreased, and his physical strength has diminished, so his mental capacities have lessened.” {CTr 6.2}"},{"t":7,"p":8,"c":"　　It is our prayer that this devotional book will help every reader be better prepared for the second coming of Christ and be among those who in eternity will enjoy the fruits of Christ’s victory in the great controversy. {CTr 6.3}"},{"t":6,"p":8,"c":"The Trustees of the Ellen G.

It was the joy of the heavenly host to fulfill the purpose of their Creator. They delighted in reflecting His glory and showing forth His praise. And while love to God was supreme, love for one another was confiding and unselfish. There was no note of discord to mar the celestial harmonies. But a change came over this happy state. There was one who perverted the freedom that God had granted to His creatures. Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been most honored of God and was highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of heaven. Lucifer, “son of the morning,” was first of the covering cherubs, holy and undefiled. He stood in the presence of the great Creator, and the ceaseless beams of glory enshrouding the eternal God rested upon him.... {CTr 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":15,"c":"　　Little by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-exaltation.... Though all his glory was from God, this mighty angel came to regard it as pertaining to himself. Not content with his position, though honored above the heavenly host, he ventured to covet homage due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking to make God supreme in the affections and allegiance of all created beings, it was his endeavor to secure their service and loyalty to himself.

But He who would have the will of all His creatures free left none unguarded to the bewildering sophistry by which rebellion would seek to justify itself.

He became the antagonist of God, an apostate, and was excluded from heaven.... He invited all the powers of evil to rally about his standard, in order to form a desperate companionship of evil to league against the God of heaven. He worked perseveringly and determinedly to perpetuate his rebellion, and to cause members of the human family to turn from Bible truth, and to stand under his banner. {CTr 10.2}"},{"t":7,"p":19,"c":"　　As soon as the Lord through Jesus Christ created our world and placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Satan announced his purpose to conform to his own nature the father and mother of all humanity, and to unite them with his own ranks of rebellion. He was determined to efface the image of God from the human posterity, and to trace his own image upon the soul in the place of the divine image. He adopted methods of deception by which to accomplish his purpose. He is called the father of lies, an accuser of God and of those who maintain their allegiance to God, a murderer from the beginning.

Though unable to expel God from His throne, Satan has charged God with satanic attributes and has claimed the attributes of God as his own.... Through his serpentine sharpness, through his crooked practices, he has drawn to himself the homage that human beings should have given to God, and has planted his satanic throne between the human worshiper and the divine Father.—Manuscript 39, 1894 (The Review and Herald, April 14, 1896). {CTr 10.4}"},{"t":4,"p":20,"c":"No Excuse for Sin, January 5"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.

But by this He would have given a precedent for the violence of human beings that is so abundantly shown in our world in the compelling principles. The Lord’s principles are not of this order.

Satan knew that the plan of salvation would be carried out to its fulfillment, that his power would be taken away, that his destruction would be certain, if Christ bore the test that Adam failed to endure.—Manuscript 65, 1894 (The Review and Herald, February 5, 1895). {CTr 203.5}"},{"t":4,"p":83,"c":"Victory Obtained in the Name of Jesus, July 16"},{"t":7,"p":84,"c":"　　To the one who conquers I will give a place with me on my throne, just as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.

No human eloquence, in strongly set forth human opinions, can change the working of satanic agencies. Satan seeks continually to block the way, so that the truth shall be bound about by human devising, and those who have light and knowledge are in the greatest danger unless they constantly consecrate themselves to God, humiliating self, and realizing the peril of the times. {CTr 368.2}"},{"t":7,"p":156,"c":"　　Heavenly beings are appointed to answer the prayers of those who are working unselfishly for the interests of the cause of God.

It is the person himself who determines which shall win. I call upon the ministers of Christ to press home upon the understanding of all who come within the reach of their voice the truth of the ministration of angels. Do not indulge in fanciful speculations. The written Word is our only safety. We must pray as did Daniel, that we may be guarded by heavenly intelligences. As ministering spirits, angels are sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. Pray ... pray as you have never prayed before. We are not prepared for the Lord’s coming.
