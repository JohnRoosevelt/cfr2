[{"n":"Foreword","ps":[{"t":2,"p":0,"c":"Foreword"},{"t":7,"p":1,"c":"　　The choice devotional readings appearing in this volume, selected to accompany an appropriate text for each day, have been drawn from the voluminous writings of Ellen G. White, who through seventy years ministered to the spiritual needs of those about her. The principles of Christian living were to her not merely the subject of writing or public address, but they were exemplified in her own life as a teen-age girl, a young woman, a mother, a helpful neighbor, a prominent figure in her community, and a world traveler. A feature of this volume that will be appreciated especially is the appearance of many select statements from Ellen White’s pen which heretofore have not been available in her current published works, for the content of this book has been drawn very largely from the thousands of E. G. White articles published originally in such weekly and monthly journals as the Youth’s Instructor, Review and Herald, Signs of the Times, et cetera, and from her manuscript files. {ML 1.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　Because the reading of each day is limited to just one printed page, much excellent material on many of the subjects could not be included, and often omissions had to be made within a given statement. All omissions are recognized in the usual way. In some cases the reading for the day consists of several choice utterances grouped together as one composite statement. At the close of the volume the individual source credits will be found. {ML 1.2}"},{"t":7,"p":3,"c":"　　Some of the words of admonition contained in this little volume were addressed originally to the family as a whole, others to parents or children or youth. Many of the statements are of a more general nature. In every case the message is one that speaks clearly to the heart of the reader regardless of age, position, or vocation. {ML 1.3}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　My Life Today was compiled under the direction of the Board of Trustees of the Ellen G.

Your course of action will determine what shall be traced by him.

Decide now, at the commencement of the new year, that you will choose the path of righteousness, that you will be earnest and true-hearted, and that life with you shall not prove a mistake.

The world, with everything in it, is yours so far as it can do you good. Even the enmity of the wicked will prove a blessing, by disciplining you for heaven.

Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter.8 {ML 6.5}"},{"t":7,"p":11,"c":"　　The surrender of all our powers to God greatly simplifies the problem of life. It weakens and cuts short a thousand struggles with the passions of the natural heart. Religion is as a golden cord that binds the souls of both youth and aged to Christ. Through it the willing and obedient are brought safely through dark and intricate paths to the city of God.... {ML 6.6}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　How many times have the deep things of God been unfolded before us, and how highly should we prize these precious privileges....

Whatever may have been your errors, He knows how to deal with them. Will you not trust yourself to Him? 10 {ML 7.2}"},{"t":7,"p":15,"c":"　　The blessing of God will rest upon every soul that makes a full consecration to Him. When we seek for God with all the heart, we shall find Him. God is in earnest with us, and He wants us to make thorough work for eternity. He has poured out all heaven in one gift, and there is no reason why we should doubt His love. Look to Calvary.... {ML 7.3}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　God asks you to give Him your heart. Your powers, your talents, your affections, should all be surrendered to Him, that He may work in you to will and to do of His good pleasure, and fit you for eternal life.11 {ML 7.4}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　When Christ dwells in the heart, the soul will be so filled with His love, with the joy of communion with Him, that it will cleave to Him; and in the contemplation of Him, self will be forgotten. Love to Christ will be the spring of action. Those who feel the constraining love of God, do not ask how little may be given to meet the requirements of God; they do not ask for the lowest standard, but aim at perfect conformity to the will of their Redeemer. With earnest desire they yield all, and manifest an interest proportionate to the value of the object which they seek.12 {ML 7.5}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　It is the submissive, teachable spirit that God wants. That which gives to prayer its excellence is the fact that it is breathed from a loving, obedient heart.13 {ML 7.6}"},{"t":4,"p":18,"c":"Ask in Faith, January 4"},{"t":7,"p":19,"c":"　　Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.

James 1:6. {ML 8.1}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　It is our privilege, our duty, to receive light from heaven, that we may perceive the wiles of Satan, and obtain strength to resist his power. Provision has been made for us to come into close connection with Christ and to enjoy the constant protection of the angels of God. Our faith must reach within the veil, where Jesus has entered for us. We must lay hold with firmer grasp on the unfailing promises of God. We must have faith that will not be denied, faith that will take hold of the unseen, faith that is steadfast, immovable. Such faith will bring the blessing of heaven to our souls. The light of the glory of God that shines in the face of Christ may shine upon us, and be reflected upon all around, so that it can be truly said of us, “Ye are the light of the world.” And it is this connection of the soul with Christ, and this alone, that can bring light to the world. Were it not for this connection, the earth would be left in utter darkness.... The deeper the surrounding gloom, the brighter should shine out the light of Christian faith and Christian example. {ML 8.2}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　The fact that unbelief prevails, that iniquity is increasing all around us, should not cause our faith to grow dim or our courage to waver.... If we will but seek God with all our hearts, if we will work with that same determined zeal, and believe with that unyielding faith, the light of heaven will shine upon us, even as it shone upon the devoted Enoch.14 {ML 8.3}"},{"t":7,"p":22,"c":"　　Oh that I could impress upon all the importance of exercising faith moment by moment, and hour by hour!

In Christ, God has provided means for subduing every evil trait, and resisting every temptation, however strong.16 {ML 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":25,"c":"　　The righteous have ever obtained help from above. How often have the enemies of God united their strength and wisdom to destroy the character and influence of a few simple persons who trusted in God. But because the Lord was for them, none could prevail against them.... Let them be separated from their idols and from the world, and the world will not separate them from God. Christ is our present, all-sufficient Saviour. In Him all fullness dwells. It is the privilege of Christians to know indeed that Christ is in them of a truth. “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” All things are possible to him that believeth; and whatsoever things we desire when we pray, if we believe that we receive them we shall have them. This faith will penetrate the darkest cloud and bring rays of light and hope to the drooping, desponding soul. It is the absence of this faith and trust which brings perplexity, distressing fears, and surmisings of evil. God will do great things for His people when they put their entire trust in Him.17 {ML 9.3}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　Through faith God’s children have “subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.” And through faith we today are to reach the heights of God’s purpose for us.18 {ML 9.4}"},{"t":4,"p":26,"c":"Have Faith in God, January 6"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

Let us not limit the Holy One of Israel.... {ML 10.2}"},{"t":7,"p":29,"c":"　　What a source to which we can look in all times of trouble; the heart can have no misgivings! Man is erring, stubborn, rebellious, and defiant even against God; but the Lord is kind and patient and of tender compassion. He has heaven and earth at His command, and He knows just what we need even before we present our necessities and desires before Him. {ML 10.3}"},{"t":7,"p":30,"c":"　　We can see only a little way before us; “but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.” He never becomes confused. He sits above the confusion and distractions of the earth, and all things are opened to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He can order that which His providence sees is best. {ML 10.4}"},{"t":7,"p":31,"c":"　　If we were left to ourselves to plan, we should make mistakes. Our prejudices, our weaknesses, our self-deceptions, and our ignorances would be manifest in many ways. But the work is the Lord’s, the cause is His; He never leaves His workmen without divine directions.... {ML 10.5}"},{"t":7,"p":32,"c":"　　Whatever burdens lay heavily, cast them on the Lord. He that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. Repose in God. He is kept in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on God. At times it will seem that you cannot take another step. Well, wait and know that “I am God.” “Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” ... We need to cherish faith.19 {ML 10.6}"},{"t":7,"p":33,"c":"　　You must learn the simple art of taking God at His word; then you have solid ground beneath your feet.20 {ML 10.7}"},{"t":4,"p":33,"c":"One With God Through Faith, January 7"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. John 17:21. {ML 11.1}"},{"t":7,"p":35,"c":"　　“I am the vine, ye are the branches.” Can we conceive of a more intimate relation to Christ than this? The fibers of the branch are almost identical with those of the vine. The communication of life, strength, and fruitfulness from the trunk to the branches is unobstructed and constant. The root sends its nourishment through the branch. Such is the true believer’s relation to Christ. He abides in Christ, and draws his nourishment from Him. {ML 11.2}"},{"t":7,"p":36,"c":"　　This spiritual relation can be established only by the exercise of personal faith. This faith must express on our part supreme preference, perfect reliance, entire consecration. Our will must be wholly yielded to the divine will; our feelings, desires, interests, and honor, identified with the prosperity of Christ’s kingdom and the honor of His cause, we constantly receiving grace from Him, and Christ accepting gratitude from us. {ML 11.3}"},{"t":7,"p":37,"c":"　　When the intimacy of connection and communion is formed, our sins are laid upon Christ, His righteousness is imputed to us. He was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. We have access to God through Him; we are accepted through the Beloved. Whoever by word or deed injures a believer, thereby wounds Jesus. Whoever gives a cup of cold water to a disciple because he is a child of God, will be regarded by Christ as giving to Himself. {ML 11.4}"},{"t":7,"p":38,"c":"　　It was when Christ was about to take leave of His disciples that He gave them the beautiful emblem of His relation to believers.... A union with Christ by living faith is enduring; every other union must perish.... The true believer chooses Christ as first and last, and best in everything.21 {ML 11.5}"},{"t":4,"p":38,"c":"Doubting Nothing, January 8"},{"t":7,"p":39,"c":"　　O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? Matthew 14:31. {ML 12.1}"},{"t":7,"p":40,"c":"　　Life is not all made up of pleasant pastures and cooling streams. Trial and disappointment overtake us; privation comes; we are brought into trying places. Conscience-stricken, we reason that we must have walked far away from God, that if we had walked with Him, we should not have suffered so. Doubt and despondency crowd into our hearts, and we say, The Lord has failed us, and we are ill-used. Why does He permit us to suffer thus? He cannot love us; if He did He would remove the difficulties from our path.... {ML 12.2}"},{"t":7,"p":41,"c":"　　He does not always bring us to pleasant places. If He did, in our self-sufficiency we should forget that He is our helper. He longs to manifest Himself to us, and to reveal the abundant supplies at our disposal, and He permits trial and disappointment to come to us that we may realize our helplessness, and learn to call upon Him for aid. He can cause cooling streams to flow from the flinty rock. {ML 12.3}"},{"t":7,"p":42,"c":"　　We shall never know until we are face to face with God, when we shall see as we are seen and know as we are known, how many burdens He has borne for us, and how many burdens He would have been glad to bear, if with childlike faith we had brought them to Him.... {ML 12.4}"},{"t":7,"p":43,"c":"　　God’s love is revealed in all His dealings with His people; and with clear, unclouded eyes, in adversity, in sickness, in disappointment, and in trial we are to behold the light of His glory in the face of Christ and trust to His guiding hand. But too often we grieve His heart by our unbelief.... {ML 12.5}"},{"t":7,"p":44,"c":"　　God loves His children, and He longs to see them overcoming the discouragement with which Satan would overpower them. Do not give way to unbelief. Do not magnify your difficulties. Remember the love and power that God has shown in times past.22 {ML 12.6}"},{"t":4,"p":44,"c":"The Touch of Faith, January 9"},{"t":7,"p":45,"c":"　　For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. Matthew 9:21, 22. {ML 13.1}"},{"t":7,"p":46,"c":"　　To talk of religious things in a casual way, to pray for spiritual blessings without real soul hunger and living faith, avails little. The wondering crowd that pressed close about Christ realized no vital power from the contact. But when the poor, suffering woman, in her great need, put forth her hand and touched the hem of Jesus’ garment, she felt the healing virtue. Hers was the touch of faith. Christ recognized that touch, and He determined there to give a lesson for all His followers to the close of time. He knew that virtue had gone out of Him, and turning about in the throng He said, “Who touched My clothes?” Surprised at such a question, His disciples answered, “Thou seest the multitude thronging Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me?” {ML 13.2}"},{"t":7,"p":47,"c":"　　Jesus fixed His eyes upon her who had done this. She was filled with fear. Great joy was hers; but had she overstepped her duty? Knowing what was done in her, she came trembling, and fell at His feet, and told Him all the truth. Christ did not reproach her. He gently said, “Go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.” {ML 13.3}"},{"t":7,"p":48,"c":"　　Here was distinguished the casual contact from the touch of faith. Prayer and preaching, without the exercise of living faith in God, will be in vain. But the touch of faith opens to us the divine treasure house of power and wisdom; and thus, through instruments of clay, God accomplishes the wonders of His grace. {ML 13.4}"},{"t":7,"p":49,"c":"　　This living faith is our great need today. We must know that Jesus is indeed ours; that His Spirit is purifying and refining our hearts. If the followers of Christ had genuine faith, with meekness and love, what a work they might accomplish! What fruit would be seen to the glory of God! 23 {ML 13.5}"},{"t":4,"p":49,"c":"God Shall Supply My Need, January 10"},{"t":7,"p":50,"c":"　　My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19. {ML 14.1}"},{"t":7,"p":51,"c":"　　It is difficult to exercise living faith when we are in darkness and discouragement. But this of all others is the very time when we should exercise faith. “But,” says one, “I do not feel at such times like praying in faith.” Well, then, will you allow Satan to gain the victory, simply because you do not feel like resisting him? When he sees that you have the greatest need of divine aid, he will try the hardest to beat you back from God. If he can keep you away from the Source of strength, he knows that you will walk in darkness and sin. There is no sin greater than unbelief. And when there is unbelief in the heart, there is danger that it will be expressed. The lips should be kept in as with bit and bridle, lest by giving expression to this unbelief you not only exert an injurious influence over others, but place yourselves upon the enemy’s ground. {ML 14.2}"},{"t":7,"p":52,"c":"　　If we believe in God, we are armed with the righteousness of Christ; we have taken hold of His strength.... We want to talk with our Saviour as though He were right by our side.... {ML 14.3}"},{"t":7,"p":53,"c":"　　It is our privilege to carry with us the credentials of our faith,—love, joy, and peace. When we do this, we shall be able to present the mighty arguments of the cross of Christ. When we learn to walk by faith and not by feeling, we shall have help from God just when we need it, and His peace will come into our hearts. It was this simple life of obedience and trust that Enoch lived. If we learn this lesson of simple trust, ours may be the testimony that he received, that he pleased God.24 {ML 14.4}"},{"t":7,"p":54,"c":"　　If we commit the keeping of our souls to God in the exercise of living faith, His promises will not fail us; for they have no limit but our faith.25 {ML 14.5}"},{"t":4,"p":54,"c":"Pray in the Morning, January 11"},{"t":7,"p":55,"c":"　　My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. Psalm 5:3. {ML 15.1}"},{"t":7,"p":56,"c":"　　The very first outbreathing of the soul in the morning should be for the presence of Jesus. “Without Me,” He says, “ye can do nothing.” It is Jesus that we need; His light, His life, His spirit, must be ours continually. We need Him every hour. And we should pray in the morning that as the sun illuminates the landscape, and fills the world with light, so the Sun of Righteousness may shine into the chambers of mind and heart, and make us all light in the Lord. We cannot do without His presence one moment. The enemy knows when we undertake to do without our Lord, and he is there, ready to fill our minds with his evil suggestions that we may fall from our steadfastness; but it is the desire of the Lord that from moment to moment we should abide in Him, and thus be complete in Him.... {ML 15.2}"},{"t":7,"p":57,"c":"　　God designs that every one of us shall be perfect in Him, so that we may represent to the world the perfection of His character.

Christ is ever sending messages to those who listen for His voice.27 {ML 15.4}"},{"t":7,"p":59,"c":"　　It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.28 {ML 15.5}"},{"t":4,"p":59,"c":"Prayer Never Out of Place, January 12"},{"t":7,"p":60,"c":"　　Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.

Now the day of God is nearer than when we first believed, and we should be more earnest, more zealous, and fervent than in those early days. Our perils are greater now than then.
