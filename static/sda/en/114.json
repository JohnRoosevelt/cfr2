[{"n":"Foreword","ps":[{"t":2,"p":0,"c":"Foreword"},{"t":7,"p":1,"c":"　　The Upward Look was first published as a devotional book for 1983. The release of this larger format edition a quarter century later provides opportunity to reflect anew on the nature of a compilation like this. Since Ellen G. White’s death in 1915, in accordance with instructions in her will, a number of compilations from her writings, including devotional books, have been produced to meet various needs. Usually these have focused on a specific theme. The Upward Look, however, is organized differently. As in This Day With God, the devotional book published three years earlier, each day’s reading draws on materials Mrs. White wrote or presented on a corresponding calendar day in her experience. For example, the reading for January 1 comes from a letter Mrs. White wrote on New Year’s Day, 1886. {UL 5.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　The readings do not follow a unified theme, except that whenever possible the excerpts are intended to bring encouragement. The selections in this volume have either never been published previously or have appeared in the Review and Herald or other periodicals rather than in books that are commonly available. Mrs. White’s broad counsel reflected here was grounded firmly in her visions, enriched by her wide experience, and aided at times by her extensive reading, from which she might adapt descriptions and choice expressions in communicating the truths she wished to convey. Despite the passage of time, these messages still strike an answering chord in hearts today. {UL 5.2}"},{"t":7,"p":3,"c":"　　Many of the messages here are personal, written to one or two people to address their specific situation. Mrs. White wrote either to encourage and comfort them or to correct and reprove then. In these messages her love and concern for them shines through. The names of people to whom she wrote these letters include some that may be familiar, such as James White, her husband; Edson and Emma White, her older son and his wife; Dr. J. H. Kellogg, medical superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium; J. A. Burden, sanitarium manager in Australia and California; Dr. J. H. Kress, medical superintendent of sanitariums in Australia and the United States; and S. N. Haskell and A. G. Daniells, both of whom held major leadership positions in the church. Some excerpts have been drawn from her daily writings in her journals or from her manuscripts and sermons. {UL 5.3}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　The Upward Look is intended to direct the reader’s attention upward—to God—in all of the experiences of life, but especially in expectation of Jesus’ soon return. After listing signs of His coming Jesus told His disciples, “‘Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near’” (Luke 21:28, NKJV). May this be your experience as you read this book. {UL 6.1}"},{"t":7,"p":5,"c":"　　"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　"},{"t":6,"p":6,"c":"The Trustees of the Ellen G.

The eye is not to be fastened upon deformity, upon the curse, but upon the riches of the grace of Christ that has been provided so abundantly, that we may live in this world, and act our part in the great web of humanity, and yet not be of the world. As pilgrims, as strangers looking for the bright things of God, the joy that is set before us, seeking a city whose builder and maker is God, and by beholding the provisions made for us, the mansions Jesus has gone to prepare for us, talking of the blessed home, we forget the annoyances and the fretting cares of this life. We seem to breathe in the very atmosphere of that better, even the heavenly country. We are soothed, we are comforted; we are more than this, we are joyful in God. {UL 15.3}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　We could not know the gracious purposes of God toward us, but for the promises, for it is from them alone we learn what He has prepared for those who love Him.

And by bringing these promises into our own life we bring them always into the lives of others. Then let us appropriate these promises to ourselves.... They are like the precious flowers in the garden of God. They are to awaken our hope and expectation, and lead us to a firm faith and reliance upon God. They are to strengthen us in trouble and teach us precious lessons of trust in God. He in these precious promises draws back from eternity and gives us a glimpse of the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Let us then be quiet in God. Let us calmly trust in Him and praise Him that He has shown us such revelations of His will and purposes that we shall not build our hopes in this life but keep the eye upward to the inheritance of light and see and sense the amazing love of Jesus.—Letter 27, January 1, 1886, to Dr. and Mrs. J.

But we must be assured of the malignity of a disease before we feel our need of a cure. Those who do not realize the sinfulness of sin are not able to appreciate the value of the atonement and the necessity of being cleansed from all sin. The sinner measures himself by himself and by those who like himself are sinners. He does not look at the purity and holiness of Christ. But when the law of God brings conviction to his heart, he says with Paul, “I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died” (Romans 7:9).... {UL 16.3}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　God created man for His glory. He will not, cannot endure the presence of sin in His dominion.

He is too pure to look upon iniquity with favor.... {UL 16.4}"},{"t":7,"p":10,"c":"　　Adam’s sin would be regarded by the churches of today as a simple mistake, to be at once forgiven and no more thought of. But God’s standard is high and His word immutable, and all selfish, covetous practices are an abomination in His sight. The hearts of believers need to be purified, sanctified, refined, ennobled.... {UL 16.5}"},{"t":7,"p":11,"c":"　　Look up, my brethren. Has the gospel lost its power to impress hearts? Is it because the regenerating influence of the Spirit of Christ has died away that hearts are not purified, sanctified, and prepared for the Holy Spirit? No; the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of the living God, is with us yet; but it must be wielded with earnestness. Let us use it as did God’s sanctified ones of old. By its living, quickening power it will cut its way to hearts.... {UL 16.6}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　The Lord calls for a reformation all through our ranks.... When the church is awakened, decided changes will be made. Men and women will be converted, and so filled will they be by the Spirit of God that they will pass from country to country, from city to city, proclaiming the message of truth.

He is our Minister and our great Medical Missionary, and He knows the straits through which His believers on this earth will pass.... He has been tempted in all points like as we are tempted. Let us not forget that Christ had the tempter to meet in every form, and that when He met him, He, our Saviour, was bearing the likeness of humanity. He is our Restorer, the Perfecter of His covenant with the human agencies who depend upon Him as their Prince and their Redeemer. {UL 17.2}"},{"t":7,"p":15,"c":"　　Christ conquered as the sinless, unfallen, perfect Man. As the Messiah He has won the victory over the temptations of the enemy, making it possible for us to overcome as He overcame. We are to overcome in every encounter with the enemy. We are to be victors by becoming partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. Each victory that He gained in His humanity makes it possible for us, through receiving and believing in Him, to gain the victory. “As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God” (John 1:12). Each victory that He gained in humanity secures for us its genuine fruits. Each assault of Satan overcome marks the occasion of a victory for humanity.... {UL 17.3}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　The deliverance of the people of God and His mercies to them in past trials are to be called to mind as an assurance of that which, if we trust in God, He will do for us in present and future emergencies. Whatever may have been their experience, if they will surrender to God with full purpose of heart, with humility and contrition, He will receive them. To all who by faith receive Christ as their personal Saviour, He will give power to become overcomers—sons and daughters of God. They become partakers of the divine nature, and fully realize His mercy and the grace of His Holy Spirit.... {UL 17.4}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　Let our prayers ascend to God in all humility.

Not one mean action can be performed without God understanding every phase of temptation.... {UL 17.5}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　Throughout the gospels, Christ made frequent reference to the great conflict that He had with Satan at the beginning of His ministry.

Sink the shaft deeper and still deeper into the mine of truth.... {UL 18.2}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　It is the privilege of every believer in Christ to possess Christ’s nature, a nature far above that which Adam forfeited by transgression.

You will not have a firm religious experience unless you dig deep, and build your house upon the Rock.... {UL 18.3}"},{"t":7,"p":22,"c":"　　Satan works through men who will be worked, blinding the perceptive faculties, paralyzing the senses with selfish ease and love of the world, and unless a special message direct from heaven comes to them they will not discern their peril. {UL 18.4}"},{"t":7,"p":23,"c":"　　Human nature is vacillating. Men grasp the truth with their perceptive powers, but they refuse to separate themselves from the world. Men will not consent to be God’s peculiar people. They know the truth of the Bible, but they do not want to obey, and they turn from the truth. They act out their unbelief, and darkness comes upon their souls.

After wrestling with God in prayer, put on the armor, and engage in earnest labor for the conversion of souls. Let men see that with you truth is not a jest, but an eternal reality. You are to deal with principles as you have never dealt with them before. Scatter the seeds of truth with no sparing hand. Sow beside all waters. Have no prescribed limits which you will not pass, but ［work］ with all the powers that God has given you. Then the people will know you as a man who believes the truth, and to whom truth is a reality. Let not your faith fail.

John 15:26. {UL 19.1}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　Those who have Jesus abiding in the heart by faith, have actually received the Holy Spirit. Every individual who receives Jesus as his personal Saviour, just as surely receives the Holy Spirit, to be his Counselor, Sanctifier, Guide, and Witness. The more closely the believer walks with God, the clearer his witness, and, as a sure result, the more powerful will be the influence of his testimony upon others of a Saviour’s love; the more he will give evidence that he prizes the Word of God. It is his meat, it is his drink, to satisfy the thirsty soul. He prizes the privilege of learning the will of God from His Word. {UL 19.2}"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　Some souls who claim to be believers have slighted, and turned from, the Word of God. They have neglected the Bible, the wonderful Guidebook, the true Tester of all ideas, and claim that they have the Spirit to teach them, that this renders searching the Scriptures unnecessary. All such are heeding the sophistry of Satan, for the Spirit and the Word agree, say the Scriptures, “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isaiah 8:20).

In our own strength we are perfect weakness, but, when we put our whole trust in Jesus Christ, we are kept by His power, for He is fully able to keep every soul that puts his trust in Him. The peril to which every soul is exposed is very great. {UL 19.4}"},{"t":7,"p":29,"c":"　　The great adversary of God, and the enemy of man, is watching to find an opportunity to take us when we are off our guard. Jesus has told us of our danger and warned us against the wily foe. He has repeatedly enjoined upon us the duty of always watching and praying, lest we enter into temptation. Believe in Jesus, trust in Jesus with living, constant faith, and rely without doubt upon Jesus to keep and save you. One mighty to save has hold upon you, and as long as you will submit to be led by Him, to learn of Him, to confide in Him, He will keep you from falling.

He will use every possible advantage you give him to control minds.... {UL 20.2}"},{"t":7,"p":32,"c":"　　God’s people, rescued from the fire by Jesus Christ, have a sense of their sin, feel humbled and ashamed. God sees and recognizes their repentance, and notes their sorrow for sin, which they cannot remove or cancel themselves. But as they pray their prayers are heard, and this is the reason that Satan stands by to resist Christ; because He hears their prayers, He maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. He regenerates the sinner, and pardon is written off against his name. This stirs Satan up to resistance. He steps in between the repenting, believing soul and Christ. He seeks to cast his hellish shadow before that soul, to dampen faith, and to make of none effect the words of God.... {UL 20.3}"},{"t":7,"p":33,"c":"　　If Satan stands between the soul and Jesus Christ, then the love and acceptance and pardon of Christ are eclipsed—man will be constantly striving to prepare a robe of righteousness to cover his deformity and sin, when Christ wants him to come to Him just as he is, and believe in Him as his personal Saviour. In His tender love, a forgiving Father brings forth His best robe in which to array His returning child.... {UL 20.4}"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　Satan is a vigilant, untiring foe, and he sleeps not. He knows that his time is short, and he will work until the end with every species of deception to draw souls into his snare and ruin them. I have a message for you—“Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.” Give no place to the devil to stand between you and Christ, lest you savor of the things that be of men and not of God.

In all business transactions the only safeguard for a man is the love and fear of God. In our world today there are seen the same dishonest practices which prevailed before the Flood swept this earth of its moral pollution, and which prevailed in Sodom before fire from heaven consumed its wicked inhabitants. Satan engrosses men’s minds with dreamlike prospects of great gain, and in their greed for gain, those who yield to him make representations which are positively untrue. God and the truth are forgotten.... {UL 21.2}"},{"t":7,"p":38,"c":"　　God desires His servants to avoid all speculation. Satan may pave the way by making the first investment successful, but O, how bitter will be the final outcome! If the professing Christian has success in his first speculation, his ruin is almost certain. Visionary schemes are wildly entered into as schemers present promising enterprises, which they declare will pay a large percentage on all money invested. Good men are fascinated and deceived.... {UL 21.3}"},{"t":7,"p":39,"c":"　　Instead of entering into speculation, let those who know the truth find some steady, honest employment, in which they can earn their living in a way that glorifies God. Those who encourage the thirst for speculation will extinguish the light that God has given to guide their feet aright. Making money easily, they will spend it unwisely, and their prodigality will be their ruin. To maintain their habits of selfish indulgence, they must continue to make money rapidly. The effort to make money fast enough to meet their extravagant expenses, draws many into the gambling hell.... {UL 21.4}"},{"t":7,"p":40,"c":"　　My prayer to our heavenly Father is, Lord, let the clear light shine forth. Carefully and prayerfully studied, God’s Word keeps men well-balanced. In this Word we find God’s way clearly defined. No one who searches the Word with sincerity will walk in darkness.

Here is the Source of divine energy. He urges no claim founded on his own merit; he has no faithfulness to present to heaven. He feels his own weakness and inefficiency, and is convinced that he must be transformed in character. Self-abasement, and self-renunciation reveal that the soul has beheld Jesus.

The leaven has a vital energy, penetrating and absorbing all the elements into which it is introduced. So likewise, the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The Word of the Lord is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. The Word is a power as we practice it. The great change that the truth makes is inward.

This anticipation, the consummation of His hopes, is expressed in His words, “The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified” (chap. 12:23). But the way and manner that this glorifying was to take place was never absent from Christ’s mind. Only by His death could the world be saved.

Here is another point in faith we wish to study, and if brought into the life and experience, it will enable everyone who fears and loves God to endure trials. God will reward the man of faith and obedience. Moses was full of confidence in God, because he had appropriating faith. He needed the help of God, and he prayed for it, and believed for it, and wove it into his life experience that God cared for him. He believed that God ruled his life in particular. He knew that God had assigned to him a special work, and he would make that work thoroughly successful so far as possible. But he knew that he could not do this without the help of God, for he had a perverse people to deal with. The presence of God, he knew, was strong enough to carry him through the most trying positions that a man could be placed in. He could see and acknowledge God in every detail of his life, that he was under the eye of an all-seeing God, who weighs motives, who tries the hearts.
