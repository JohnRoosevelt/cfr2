He who upholds the unnumbered worlds throughout immensity, at the same time cares for the wants of the little brown sparrow that sings its humble song without a fear. When men go forth to their daily toil, as when they engage in prayer; when they lie down at night, and when they rise in the morning; when the rich man feasts in his palace, or when the poor man gathers his children about the scanty board, each is tenderly watched by the heavenly Father.

Meekness is patient, and labors to be happy under all circumstances. Meekness is always thankful, and makes its own songs of happiness, making melody in the heart to God. Meekness will suffer disappointment and wrong, and will not retaliate. Meekness is not to be silent and sulky.

He set at naught the artificial distinctions of society. The aristocracy of birth, wealth, talent, learning, rank, He ignored....

Envy will not be in his heart; evil surmisings will find no room there; hatred cannot exist.

The spirit of peace will rest like dew upon hearts weary and troubled with worldly strife.—Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 27. {RRe 12.2}"},{"t":7,"p":40,"c":"　　“Blessed are the peacemakers.” The peace of Christ is born of truth. It is harmony with God. The world is at enmity with the law of God; sinners are at enmity with their Maker; and as a result they are at enmity with one another. But the psalmist declares, “Great peace have they which love Thy law; and nothing shall offend them.” Men cannot manufacture peace. Human plans for the purification and uplifting of individuals or of society will fail of producing peace, because they do not reach the heart. The only power that can create or perpetuate true peace is the grace of Christ. When this is implanted in the heart, it will cast out the evil passions that cause strife and dissension. “Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree”; and life’s desert “shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.”—The Desire of Ages, 302-305. {RRe 12.3}"},{"t":4,"p":40,"c":"He Whose Helper Is God, January 11"},{"t":7,"p":41,"c":"　　Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord, his God.

Lonely and outcast as he was, separated from all that had made life dear, the one thought that above all others pressed upon his soul, was the fear that his sin had cut him off from God, that he was forsaken of Heaven. In sadness he lay down to rest on the bare earth, around him only the lonely hills, and above, the heavens bright with stars. As he slept, a strange light broke upon his vision; and lo, from the plain on which he lay, vast shadowy stairs seemed to lead upward to the very gates of heaven, and upon them angels of God were passing up and down; while from the glory above, the divine voice was heard in a message of comfort and hope. Thus was made known to Jacob that which met the need and longing of his soul,—a Saviour.

Their every word and act was to fasten attention on His name, as possessing that vital power by which sinners may be saved. Their faith was to center in Him who is the source of mercy and power. In His name they were to present their petitions to the Father, and they would receive answer. They were to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
