White, as she journeyed along life’s pathway, was ever ready to lend a helping hand or speak an encouraging word. Every Christian was to her a son or a daughter of God, with unlimited opportunities stretching before him, and angels of God by his side to guard and guide him. From her tireless and inspired pen there flowed a steady stream of messages of encouragement, counsel, instruction, and enlightenment. From week to week through the Youth’s Instructor she spoke to the youth of the church, and in the Review and Herald addressed its members generally. Her books preserved the instruction and warning in more permanent form for all to read. Many benefited by communications addressed to them personally. {SD 5.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　In this volume, with its daily devotional readings, have been assembled appropriate counsel and instruction drawn from these accumulated E.

In each case, whether drawn from book, periodical article, or manuscript, the source reference is given.

The laws and operations of nature, which have engaged men’s study for six thousand years, were opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and Upholder of all. They held converse with leaf and flower and tree, gathering from each the secrets of its life. With every living creature, from the mighty leviathan that playeth among the waters, to the insect mote that floats in the sunbeam, Adam was familiar. He had given to each its name, and he was acquainted with the nature and habits of all.

Without this holiness, the human heart is selfish, sinful, and vicious. Holiness will lead its possessor to be fruitful, and abound in all good works.

He gave His Son to become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full of grace and truth.” Christ by His human relationship to men drew them close to God.

The object-lesson given at the birth of the nation was of a nature deeply to impress all hearts. Before the last terrible judgment came upon the Egyptians in the death of the first-born, God commanded His people to gather their children into their own homes. The doorpost of every house was marked with blood, and within the protection assured by this token all were to abide.
