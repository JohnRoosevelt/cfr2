Those who appreciate this great sacrifice receive from the Saviour that most precious of all gifts—a clean heart. They gain an experience that is more valuable than gold or silver or precious stones. They sit together in heavenly places in Christ, enjoying in communion with Him the joy and peace that He alone can give. They love Him with heart and mind and soul and strength, realizing that they are His blood-bought heritage. Their spiritual eyesight is not dimmed by worldly policy or worldly aims.

Therefore he has sought to misrepresent the character of God, to lead men to cherish a false conception of Him.

But you need not be among those who will come under His wrath. We are living in the day of His salvation.

The goodness, wisdom, and power of God are manifest everywhere. In mountains, rocks, hills, and valleys, I see the works of divine power.

Christ does not try to prove the great mystery, but reveals a love that is beyond measurement. He does not make God’s power and greatness the chief theme of His discourses. He speaks of Him oftenest as our Father.... He desires our minds, weakened by sin, to be encouraged to grasp the idea that God is love.... {HP 10.2}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　The father of the prodigal son is the type that Christ chooses as a representation of God. This father longs to see and receive once more the son who has left him. He waits and watches for him, yearning to see him, hoping that he will come. When he sees a stranger approaching, poor and clothed with rags, he goes out to meet him, if perchance it may be his son. And he feeds and clothes him as if he were indeed his son. By and by he has his reward, for his son comes home, on his lips the beseeching confession, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.” And the father says to the servants, “Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry” (Luke 15:21-23). {HP 10.3}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　There is no taunting, no casting up to the prodigal of his evil course.

And how are we to know Him and the power of His love? It is through diligent search of the Scriptures. We cannot appreciate God unless we take into our souls the great plan of redemption. We want to know all about these grand problems of the soul, of the redemption of the fallen race. It is a wonderful thing that after man had violated the law of God and separated himself from God, was divorced, as it were, from God—that after all this there was a plan made whereby man should not perish, but that he should have everlasting life.... God gave His only-begotten Son to die for us....

All the universe of heaven was looking on with intense interest. Why? The great battle was to be fought between the power of darkness and the Prince of light. Satan’s work was to magnify his power constantly.... He was all the time placing God in a false light. He was presenting Him as a God of injustice, and not a God of mercy.

It was because of sin that mercy was brought into active exercise. {HP 12.2}"},{"t":7,"p":31,"c":"　　Sin is not the object of God’s love, but of His hatred. But He loves and pities the sinner.

On the one side there are infinite wisdom, goodness, compassion, power; on the other, weakness, sinfulness, absolute helplessness, poverty, dependence.... Man is given the privilege of working with God in the saving of his own soul. He is to receive Christ as his personal Saviour and believe in Him. Receiving and believing is his part of the contract.... {HP 12.4}"},{"t":7,"p":33,"c":"　　The plan of redemption was arranged in the counsels between the Father and the Son. Then Christ pledged Himself to render an account for man if he proved disloyal. He pledged Himself to make an atonement which would unite every believing soul to God. He who lays his sins upon the substitute and surety ... can unite with the apostle in saying: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places.” “That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 1:3; Ephesians 2:7). {HP 12.5}"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　In His infinite love Christ devised the plan of salvation. This plan He stands ready to fulfill in behalf of all who will cooperate with Him. In their behalf He says to the Father, Do not impute their sins to them, but lay them on Me.

Romans 5:8. {HP 13.1}"},{"t":7,"p":36,"c":"　　As soon as there was sin, there was a Saviour. Christ knew that He would have to suffer, yet He became man’s substitute. As soon as Adam sinned, the Son of God presented Himself as surety for the human race.10 {HP 13.2}"},{"t":7,"p":37,"c":"　　Think of how much it cost Christ to leave the heavenly courts, and take His position at the head of humanity. Why did He do this? Because He was the only one who could redeem the fallen race. There was not a human being in the world who was without sin. The Son of God stepped down from His heavenly throne, laid off His royal robe and kingly crown, and clothed His divinity with humanity. He came to die for us, to lie in the tomb as human beings must, and to be raised for our justification. He came to become acquainted with all the temptations wherewith man is beset. He rose from the grave and proclaimed over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, “I am the resurrection, and the life.” One equal with God passed through death in our behalf. He tasted death for every man, that through Him every man might be a partaker of eternal life. {HP 13.3}"},{"t":7,"p":38,"c":"　　Christ ascended to heaven, bearing a sanctified, holy humanity. He took this humanity with Him into the heavenly courts, and through the eternal ages He will bear it as the One who has redeemed every human being in the city of God, the One who has pleaded before the Father, “I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.” The palms of His hands bear the marks of the wounds that He received. If we are wounded and bruised, if we meet with difficulties that are hard to manage, let us remember how much Christ suffered for us.... {HP 13.4}"},{"t":7,"p":39,"c":"　　Our Saviour bore all that we are called upon to bear, so that no human being could say, “He does not know my suffering and my trials.” In all our afflictions He was afflicted.... {HP 13.5}"},{"t":7,"p":40,"c":"　　Satan declared that human beings could not live without sin.

It is the most exalted, sacred theme on which we can meditate. Every heart that is enlightened by the grace of God is constrained to bow with inexpressible gratitude and adoration before the Redeemer for His infinite sacrifice. {HP 14.3}"},{"t":7,"p":44,"c":"　　In His life Jesus of Nazareth differed from all other men.... He is the only true model of goodness and perfection. From the beginning of His ministry men began more clearly to comprehend the character of God.... Christ’s mission on earth was to reveal to men that God was not a despot, but a heavenly Father, full of love and mercy for His children. He spoke of God by the endearing title of “My Father.” ... {HP 14.4}"},{"t":7,"p":45,"c":"　　In all the sufferings and afflictions of man there is an Eye to pity, a Heart to love. “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him” (Psalm 103:13). God’s tenderest care is exercised over us. He pities us in our weakness and in our sorrow. We may be despondent, even despairing; the heavy clouds of affliction may be over us; but there is light ahead. Beyond the gloom is a sympathetic, compassionate Friend, One who does not willingly grieve or afflict the children of men.12 {HP 14.5}"},{"t":7,"p":46,"c":"　　In the gracious blessings which our heavenly Father has bestowed upon us we may discern innumerable evidences of a love that is infinite, and a tender pity surpassing a mother’s yearning sympathy for her wayward child. When we study the divine character in the light of the cross we see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness blended with equity and justice.

The whole debt for the transgression of God’s law was demanded from our Mediator. A full atonement was required. How appropriate are the words of Isaiah, “It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.” His soul was made “an offering for sin.” “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities” (Isaiah 53:10, 5). {HP 15.2}"},{"t":7,"p":49,"c":"　　Jesus suffered the extreme penalty of the law for our transgression, and justice was fully satisfied.

In the day of final reckoning, position, rank, or wealth will not alter by a hairbreadth the case of any one.

Angels of God are there, and their presence makes the crust of bread and the cup of water a banquet.
