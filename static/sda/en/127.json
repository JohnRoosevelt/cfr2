Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings will find in the cross of Christ their science and their song. It will be seen that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love. In the light from Calvary it will be seen that the law of self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven; that the love which “seeketh not her own” has its source in the heart of God; and that in the meek and lowly One is manifested the character of Him who dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.... {RC 15.4}"},{"t":7,"p":5,"c":"　　We behold God in Jesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our God to give. “I do nothing of myself,” said Christ; “the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father.” “I seek not mine own glory,” but the glory of Him that sent Me (John 8:28; 6:57; John 8:50; 7:18). In these words is set forth the great principle which is the law of life for the universe. All things Christ received from God, but He took to give. So in the heavenly courts, in His ministry for all created beings: through the beloved Son, the Father’s life flows out to all; through the Son it returns, in praise and joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all.

It is His purpose, by the elevating, sanctifying power of the truth, to give men nobility and dignity.

In smiting Christ, Satan thought to destroy the Prince of life; but from the smitten rock there flowed living water.

Many of those who heard Jesus were mourners over disappointed hopes, many were nourishing a secret grief, many were seeking to satisfy their restless longing with the things of the world and the praise of men; but when all was gained, they found that they had toiled only to reach a broken cistern, from which they could not quench their thirst.

In every city, every town, every village through which He passed, He laid His hands upon the afflicted ones, and healed them. Wherever there were hearts ready to receive His message, He comforted them with the assurance of their heavenly Father’s love.

Had it been possible for the law to be changed or set aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the penalty of sin.

It is a revelation of the will and the character of its Author. God is love, and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and love to man. “Love is the fulfilling of the law” (Romans 13:10). The character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the nature of His law. Says the psalmist: “Thy law is the truth”; “all thy commandments are righteousness” (Psalm 119:142, 172). And the apostle Paul declares: “The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good” (Romans 7:12).

But sin alienated him from his Maker. He no longer reflected the divine image.... But “God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,” that man might be reconciled to God.

He must exercise repentance toward God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ, His atoning sacrifice. Thus he obtains “remission of sins that are past” and becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is a child of God, having received the spirit of adoption, whereby he cries: “Abba, Father”! {RC 47.2}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　Is he now free to transgress God’s law? Says Paul: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law” (Romans 3:31). “How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?” (chap. 6:2). And John declares: “This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous” (1 John 5:3). In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then “the righteousness of the law” will “be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans 8:4).

The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth” (John 17:17).

The Christian will feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is where Christ’s help is needed.

True meekness softens and subdues the heart and gives the mind a fitness for the engrafted Word. It brings the thoughts into obedience to Jesus Christ. It opens the heart to the Word of God, as Lydia’s was opened.

Separated from God, existence may be ours for a little time, but we do not possess life.... Only through the surrender of our will to God is it possible for Him to impart life to us. Only by receiving His life through self-surrender is it possible, said Jesus, for these hidden sins ... to be overcome. It is possible that you may bury them in your hearts and conceal them from human eyes, but how will you stand in God’s presence? ... To sin, wherever found, God is a consuming fire.... {RC 377.4}"},{"t":7,"p":185,"c":"　　It will require a sacrifice to give yourself to God; but it is a sacrifice of the lower for the higher, the earthly for the spiritual, the perishable for the eternal. God does not design that our will should be destroyed, for it is only through its exercise that we can accomplish what He would have us do. Our will is to be yielded to Him, that we may receive it again, purified and refined, and so linked in sympathy with the Divine that He can pour through us the tides of His love and power. However bitter and painful this surrender may appear to the willful, wayward heart, yet “it is profitable for thee.” {RC 377.5}"},{"t":7,"p":186,"c":"　　Not until he fell crippled and helpless upon the breast of the covenant angel did Jacob know the victory of conquering faith and receive the title of a prince with God.—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 60-62. {RC 377.6}"},{"t":4,"p":186,"c":"The Pure in Heart to Reflect Christ, December 30"},{"t":7,"p":187,"c":"　　He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.—Proverbs 22:11, R.S.V. {RC 378.1}"},{"t":7,"p":188,"c":"　　Into the City of God there will enter nothing that defiles.

The purpose formed in the heart need not be expressed in word or deed in order to make it sin, and bring the soul into condemnation. Every thought, feeling, and inclination, though unseen by men, is discerned by the eye of God.
