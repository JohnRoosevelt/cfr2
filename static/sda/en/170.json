God calls upon them to sound an alarm among the people. Let it be heard in all the plain. The day of woe, of wasting and destruction, is upon all who do unrighteousness. With special severity will the Lord’s hand fall upon the watchmen who have failed to place before the people in clear lines their obligation to Him who by creation and by redemption is their owner. {SpTB01 3.1}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　My brethren, the Lord calls upon you to examine the heart closely. He calls upon you to adorn the truth in your daily practise, and in all your dealings with one another. He requires of you a faith that works by love and purifies the soul. It is dangerous for you to trifle with the sacred demands of conscience, dangerous for you to set an example that leads others in a wrong direction. {SpTB01 3.2}"},{"t":7,"p":5,"c":"　　Christians should carry with them, wherever they go, the sweet fragrance of Christ’s righteousness, showing that they are complying with the invitation, “Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.” Matthew 11:29, 30. Are you learning daily in the school of Christ,—learning how to dismiss doubt and evil surmisings, learning how to be fair and noble in your dealings with your brethren, for your own sake, and for Christ’ sake? {SpTB01 3.3}"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　Present truth leads onward and upward, gathering in the needy, the oppressed, the suffering, the destitute. All that will come are to be brought into the fold. In their lives there is to take place a reformation that will constitute them members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. By hearing the message of truth, men and women are led to accept the Sabbath, and to unite with the church by baptism. They are to bear God’s sign by observing the Sabbath of creation. They are to know for themselves that obedience to God’s commandments means eternal life. {SpTB01 3.4}"},{"t":7,"p":7,"c":"　　Means and earnest labor may be safely invested in such a work as this, for it is a work that will endure. Thus those who have been dead in trespasses and sins are brought into fellowship with the saints, and are made to sit in heavenly places with Christ. Their feet are placed on a sure foundation. They are enabled to reach a high standard, even the loftiest heights of faith, because Christians make straight paths for their feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way. {SpTB01 4.1}"},{"t":7,"p":8,"c":"　　Every church should labor for the perishing within its own borders and for those outside its borders. The members are to shine as living stones in the temple of God, reflecting heavenly light. No random, haphazard, desultory work is to be done. To get fast hold of souls ready to perish means more than praying for a drunkard, and then, because he weeps and confesses the pollution of his soul, declaring him saved. Over and over again the battle must be fought. {SpTB01 4.2}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　Let the members of every church feel it their special duty to labor for those in their neighborhood. Let each one who claims to stand under the banner of Christ feel that he has entered into covenant relation with God, to do the work of the Saviour. Let not those who take up this work become weary in welldoing. When the redeemed stand before God, precious souls will respond to their names who are there because of the faithful, patient efforts put forth in their behalf, the entreaties and earnest persuasions to flee to the Stronghold. Thus those who in this world have been laborers together with God will receive their reward. {SpTB01 4.3}"},{"t":7,"p":10,"c":"　　The ministers of the popular churches will not allow the truth to be presented to the people from their pulpits. The enemy leads them to resist the truth with bitterness and malice. Falsehoods are manufactured. Christ’s experience with the Jewish rulers is repeated. Satan strives to eclipse every ray of light shining from God to His people. He works through the ministers as he worked through the priests and rulers in the days of Christ. Will those who know the truth join his party, to hinder, embarrass, and turn aside those who are trying to work in God’s appointed way to advance His work, to plant the standard of truth in the regions of darkness? {SpTB01 5.1}"},{"t":4,"p":10,"c":"Our Message"},{"t":7,"p":11,"c":"　　The third angel’s message, embracing the messages of the first and second angels, is the message for this time. We are to raise aloft the banner on which is inscribed, “The commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” The world is soon to meet the great Law-giver over His broken law. This is not the time to put out of sight the great issues before us. God calls upon His people to magnify the law, and make it honorable. {SpTB01 5.2}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy, the Sabbath was given to the world, that man might ever remember that in six days God created the world. He rested upon the seventh day, blessing it as the day of His rest, and gave it to the beings He had created, that they might remember Him as the true and living God. {SpTB01 5.3}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　By His mighty power, notwithstanding the opposition of Pharaoh, God delivered His people from Egypt, that they might keep the law which had been given in Eden. He brought them to Sinai to hear the proclamation of this law. {SpTB01 6.1}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　By proclaiming the ten commandments to the children of Israel with His own voice, God demonstrated their importance. In awful grandeur He made known His majesty and authority as Ruler of the world. This He did to impress the people with the sacredness of His law and the importance of obeying it. The power and glory with which the law was given reveal its importance. It is the faith once delivered to the saints by Christ our Redeemer speaking from Sinai. {SpTB01 6.2}"},{"t":7,"p":15,"c":"　　The Sign of our Relationship to God. By the observance of the Sabbath, the children of Israel were to be distinguished from all other nations. “Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep,” Christ said: “for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.... It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.” “Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.” Exodus 31:13, 17, 16. {SpTB01 6.3}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　The Sabbath is a sign of the relationship existing between God and His people,—a sign that they are His obedient subjects, that they keep holy His law. The observance of the Sabbath is the means ordained by God of preserving a knowledge of Himself and of distinguishing between His loyal subjects and the transgressors of His law. {SpTB01 6.4}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　This is the faith once delivered to the saints, who stand in moral power before the world, firmly maintaining this faith. {SpTB01 7.1}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　Opposition we shall have as we voice the message of the third angel. Satan will bring in every possible device to make of no effect the faith once delivered to the saints. “Many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.” 2 Peter 2:2, 3. But in spite of opposition, all are to hear the words of truth. {SpTB01 7.2}"},{"t":7,"p":19,"c":"　　The law of God is the foundation of all enduring reformation. We are to present to the world in clear, distinct lines the need of obeying this law. Obedience to God’s law is the greatest incentive to industry, economy, truthfulness, and just dealing between man and man. {SpTB01 7.3}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　The law of God is to be the means of education in the family. Parents are under a most solemn obligation to obey this law, setting their children an example of the strictest integrity. Men in responsible positions, whose influence is far-reaching, are to guard well their ways and works, keeping the fear of the Lord ever before them. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Psalm 111:10. Those who hearken diligently to the voice of the Lord and cheerfully keep His commandments, will be among the number who see God. “The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us.” Deuteronomy 6:24, 25. {SpTB01 7.4}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　Our work as believers in the truth is to present before the world the immutability of the law of God. Ministers and teachers, physicians and nurses, are bound by covenant with God to present the importance of obeying His law. We are to be distinguished as a people who keep the commandments. The Lord has stated explicitly that He has a work to be done for the world. How shall it be done? Let us seek to find the best way, and then perform the will of the Lord. {SpTB01 8.1}"},{"t":7,"p":22,"c":"　　This world is a training-school for the higher school, this life a preparation for the life to come. Here we are to be prepared for entrance into the heavenly courts. Here we are to receive and believe and practise the truth, until we are made ready for a home with the saints in light. {SpTB01 8.2}"},{"t":4,"p":22,"c":"A Word of Caution"},{"t":8,"p":22,"c":"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, October 26, 1898"},{"t":7,"p":23,"c":"　　To the Advisers of Medical Students:"},{"t":7,"p":24,"c":"　　There is a burden upon my soul. There are young people who are encouraged to take up a course of study in medical lines who ought to be preparing themselves most decidedly to proclaim the third angel’s message. It is not necessary for our medical students to spend all the time that they are spending in medical studies. Their work should be more decidedly combined with a study of God’s word. Ideas are inculcated that are not at all necessary, and the necessary things do not receive sufficient attention. {SpTB01 9.1}"},{"t":4,"p":24,"c":"A Danger to be Guarded Against"},{"t":7,"p":25,"c":"　　While students are being educated in this way, they are being made less able to do acceptable work for the Master. The taxation that they undergo to obtain an extended knowledge in medical lines unfits them to work as they should in ministerial lines. Physical and mental weariness come because of the over-strain of study, and because the students are encouraged to labor unduly for the outcasts and the degraded. Thus some are disqualified for the work that they might have done had they begun missionary work where it was needed, and let the medical line come in as an essential part, connected with the work of the gospel ministry as a whole, as the hand is connected with the body. Life is not to be imperiled in an effort to obtain a medical education. There is danger, in some cases, that students will ruin their health and unfit themselves to do the service they might have done had they not been unwisely encouraged to take a medical course. {SpTB01 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　Often erroneous opinions are transcribed on the mind, and these lead to an unwise course of action. Students should have time to talk with God, time to live in hourly, conscious communion with the principles of truth and righteousness and mercy. At this time straightforward investigation of the heart is essential. The student must place himself where he can draw from the Source of spiritual and intellectual power. He must require that every cause which asks his sympathy and co-operation has the approval of the reason which God had given him, and the conscience, which the Holy Spirit is controlling. He is not to perform an action that does not harmonize with the deep, holy principles which minister light to his soul and vigor to his will. Only thus can he do God the highest service. He is not to be taught that medical missionary work will bind him to any man, who shall dictate what his work shall be. {SpTB01 10.1}"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　Medical missionary work is not to be drawn apart and made separate from church organization. The medical students are not to receive the idea that they may regard themselves as amenable only to the leaders in the medical work. They are to be left free to receive counsel from God. They are not to pledge themselves and their future to anything that erring human beings may outline for them. No thread of selfishness is to be drawn into the web; no scheme is to be devised that has in it one particle of injustice. Selfishness is not to control any line of the work. Let us remember that individually we are working in full view of the heavenly universe. {SpTB01 10.2}"},{"t":4,"p":27,"c":"A High Standard"},{"t":7,"p":28,"c":"　　“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.” Luke 10:27. Just before He left His disciples to return to heaven, Christ declared, “A new commandment I give unto you. That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.” Here we see the standard lifted higher and still higher. “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.” John 13:34, 35. The disciples could not then comprehend Christ’s words, but after His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, they understood His love as never before. They had seen it expressed in His suffering in the garden, in the judgment-hall, and in His death on the cross of Calvary. {SpTB01 11.1}"},{"t":7,"p":29,"c":"　　Be careful. Take heed. Let God enter to control the work. He will make His own combinations and arrangements. The Lord has need of men of intense spiritual life. Are we prepared to do the work for this time? The Lord has declared the source of the strength of His people. “Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.” Zechariah 4:6. {SpTB01 11.2}"},{"t":4,"p":29,"c":"Teaching and Healing"},{"t":7,"p":30,"c":"　　The Lord’s people are to be one. There is to be no separation in His work. Christ sent out the twelve apostles, and afterward the seventy disciples, to preach the gospel and to heal the sick. “As ye go,” He said, “preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.” Matthew 10:7, 8. And as they went forth preaching the kingdom of God, power was given them to heal the sick and cast out evil spirits. In God’s work teaching and healing are never to be separated. His commandment-keeping people are to be one. Satan will invent every device to separate those whom God is seeking to make one. But the Lord will reveal Himself as a God of judgment. We are working under the eyes of the heavenly host. There is a divine Watcher among us, inspecting all that is planned and carried on. {SpTB01 11.3}"},{"t":7,"p":31,"c":"　　The noblest men, those who stand highest in the estimation of the heavenly universe, are the wrestlers,—those who co-operate with God by using every power of mind and body in His service. He who thus fulfils His responsibilities, acting his part as a toiler, striving to follow the perfect example that Christ has set, will be recognized and honored by God. {SpTB01 12.1}"},{"t":4,"p":31,"c":"Christ the Medium of Prayer and Blessing"},{"t":8,"p":31,"c":"Balaclava, Victoria, Australia, March 25, 1898"},{"t":8,"p":31,"c":"To a Sanitarium Physician:"},{"t":7,"p":32,"c":"　　My Dear Brother,"},{"t":7,"p":33,"c":"　　I have just received your letters. I see that you are having a close battle financially. I am so glad that you can heed the encouragement in the words, “Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.” Isaiah 27:5. Let us have faith in God. Let us put our trust in Him. He understands all about the situation in which we are placed, and He will work in our behalf. He is honored when we trust in Him, bringing to Him all our perplexities. “Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name,” Christ says, “that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” John 14:13. God’s appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit. The throne of grace itself is occupied by One who permits us to call Him Father. {SpTB01 13.1}"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　“God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” John 3:16. Jehovah did not deem the plan of salvation complete while invested only with His love. He has placed at His altar an Advocate clothed in our nature. As our intercessor, Christ’s office-work is to introduce us to God as His sons and daughters. He intercedes in behalf of those who receive Him. With His own blood He has paid their ransom. By virtue of His merits, He gives them power to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. And the Father demonstrates His infinite love for Christ by receiving and welcoming Christ’s friends as His friends. He is satisfied with the atonement made. He is glorified by the incarnation, the life, death, and mediation of His Son. {SpTB01 13.2}"},{"t":7,"p":35,"c":"　　In Christ’s name our petitions ascend to the Father. He intercedes in our behalf, and the Father lays open all the treasures of His grace for our appropriation, for us to enjoy and impart to others. “Ask in My name,” Christ says. “I do not say that I will pray the Father for you; for the Father Himself loveth you. Make use of My name. This will give your prayers efficiency, and the Father will give you the riches of His grace. Wherefore ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” {SpTB01 14.1}"},{"t":7,"p":36,"c":"　　Christ is the connecting link between God and man. He has promised His personal intercession. He places the whole virtue of His righteousness on the side of the suppliant. He pleads for man, and man, in need of divine help, pleads for himself in the presence of God, using the influence of the One who gave His life for the life of the world. As we acknowledge before God our appreciation of Christ’s merits, fragrance is given to our intercessions. As we approach God through the virtue of the Redeemer’s merits, Christ places us close by His side, encircling us with His human arm, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. He puts His merits, as sweet incense, in the censer in our hands, in order to encourage our petitions. He promises to hear and answer our supplications. {SpTB01 14.2}"},{"t":7,"p":37,"c":"　　Yes; Christ has become the medium of prayer between man and God. He has also become the medium of blessing between God and man. He has united divinity with humanity. Men are to co-operate with Him for the salvation of their own souls, and then make earnest, persevering efforts to save those who are ready to die. {SpTB01 14.3}"},{"t":7,"p":38,"c":"　　We must all work now, while the day lasts; for the night cometh, in which no man can work. I am of good courage in the Lord. There are times when I am shown distinctly that there exists in our churches a state of things that will not help but hinder souls. Then I have hours, and sometimes days, of intense anguish. Many of those who have a knowledge of the truth do not obey the words of God. Their influence is no better than the influence of worldlings. They talk like the world and act like the world. O, how my heart aches as I think of how the Saviour is put to shame by their unchristlike behavior! But after the agony is past, I feel like working harder than ever to restore the poor souls, that they may reveal the image of God. {SpTB01 15.1}"},{"t":7,"p":39,"c":"　　Pray, yes, pray with unshaken faith and trust. The Angel of the Covenant, even our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Mediator who secures the acceptance of the prayers of His believing ones. {SpTB01 15.2}"},{"t":4,"p":39,"c":"A Right Use of God’s Gifts"},{"t":8,"p":39,"c":"St. Helena, Cal., June 24, 1903"},{"t":8,"p":39,"c":"To a Young Physician"},{"t":7,"p":40,"c":"　　Dear Brother,"},{"t":7,"p":41,"c":"　　There are many of our young physicians who in obtaining their education have accumulated a burden of debt, and who, by their association with self-indulgent men, have come to look upon expensive living as a necessity. {SpTB01 16.1}"},{"t":7,"p":42,"c":"　　When these students consecrated themselves to the medical missionary work, they were sincere in their determination to become Christian physicians, to be workers together with God, united with Him in unselfish ministry for the sick and the distressed; but in the multiplicity of their studies, and as they associated with worldly teachers and students, their Christian zeal weakened, and a zeal for self-advancement imperceptibly took its place. {SpTB01 16.2}"},{"t":7,"p":43,"c":"　　It is when school work is ended, and decisions must be made as to the field and the character of future labor, that it is of the utmost importance that our young physicians shall realize that their talents are not their own, that they belong to the Master. Let them determine that they will not accept the praise and flattery of men, but that they will use wisely, judiciously, and with the strictest integrity, all the gifts God has lent them. Their talents are to be increased by wise use, and returned to the Giver. This the word of God specifies as their duty. They are to be producers as well as consumers. {SpTB01 16.3}"},{"t":7,"p":44,"c":"　　My brother, you have grown to manhood without learning the lesson that all should learn in childhood and youth, the lesson of self-denial and self-sacrifice. For your present and future good, remember that you are responsible for the use you make of your Lord’s gifts. God has given you genius and capabilities. Ever realize that you must make the best use of your talents, because they are not your own. They are entrusted to you by God, not to be used in pleasing and gratifying impulse, but for Him and Him alone, because they are His. {SpTB01 16.4}"},{"t":7,"p":45,"c":"　　The Lord has given you your work. He expects you each week to interview yourself, to find out how you are trading on your Lord’s goods. Are you putting to the tax your physical, mental, and spiritual powers in an effort to please the Lord, who desires you to accumulate talents by right use of those He has given you? {SpTB01 17.1}"},{"t":7,"p":46,"c":"　　Your being a physician, in no wise releases you from the necessity of practising economy. There are new fields to be entered, and to enter these fields requires the closest economy. Will you be content to let others lift the cross and practise self-denial, while you indulge your fancies, spending money freely to make a show? God requires you to accomplish good with every jot of your influence and with every dollar of your money. Then will be seen the most blessed results. {SpTB01 17.2}"},{"t":7,"p":47,"c":"　　You need to learn the art of using your talents for the glory of Him who has lent them to you. This requires study, and prayer, and consecration. You should learn the science of handling money aright. Then you will not allow it to pass through your hands without producing anything for God. {SpTB01 17.3}"},{"t":4,"p":47,"c":"Not Our Own"},{"t":7,"p":48,"c":"　　My brother, we are not our own. We have been bought with a price. If we co-operate with God, we can advance His kingdom. Neither you nor I nor any other soul should feel at liberty to underrate the talents God has given us, be they many or few. God demands a faithful return of His entrusted goods. He calls upon us to enter His school, and learn day by day how to do the work He has given us. No soul is to be an idler. If we fail to use God’s gifts aright, how shall we answer Him when He calls upon us for an account of our stewardship? He says, “Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.” Revelation 22:12. {SpTB01 17.4}"},{"t":7,"p":49,"c":"　　I have written plainly. Many, looking at the outward appearance of your work, would praise and flatter you. But I have no words of flattery to offer. I know that means which should have been sacredly devoted to the work of the Lord has been used in other ways. {SpTB01 18.1}"},{"t":7,"p":50,"c":"　　God calls upon you to be a man, and put away your extravagance. Extravagant ideas must not be indulged under the name of medical missionary work. It is high time that we became Christians in heart. Integrity, self-denial, and humility should characterize our lives. Study diligently to learn the meaning of the words, “If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” Matthew 16:24. {SpTB01 18.2}"},{"t":7,"p":51,"c":"　　While laboring in this world as the great medical missionary, Christ denied Himself every luxury. He suffered that you might secure salvation. For you He endured death on the cross, despising the shame. He descended to the lowest depths of humiliation that you might sit in heavenly places. Behold His love. Does it not put to shame your extravagant outlay of means, that you may make a show in the world? How much owest thou unto thy Lord? Can you compute the sum? All that He possessed, He gave for your salvation, and He calls upon you to consecrate yourself to His service. Review from the first your service to God, and henceforth follow the example of the Saviour, not the example of worldlings.

Are you doing all that you can to help? God has given us a commission which angels might envy. The church has been charged to convey to the world, without delay, God’s saving mercy. This is the trust that He has given us, and it is to be faithfully executed. Medical missionary work is to be done. Thousands upon thousands of human beings are perishing in sin. The compassion of God is moved. All heaven is looking on with intense interest to see what character medical missionary work will assume under supervision of human beings. Will men make merchandise of God’s ordained plan for reaching the dark parts of the earth with a manifestation of His benevolence? Will they cover mercy with selfishness, and then call it medical missionary work? {SpTB01 19.1}"},{"t":7,"p":53,"c":"　　Medical missionary work is a sacred plan of God’s own devising. After Adam’s transgression, a costly price was paid to rescue the fallen race.

This represents the speed and directness with which the church is to prosecute her work. In the medical missionary work done by His followers, Jesus is to behold the travail of His soul. Human beings are to be snatched as brands from the burning. {SpTB01 19.3}"},{"t":7,"p":55,"c":"　　All heaven is watching with intense anxiety to see what is to be the outcome of the work that is so large and so important. God is watching, the heavenly universe is watching; and souls are perishing. And a change has come that has hindered the work which God designed should move forward without a trace of selfishness. Is the enterprise of mercy through which in the past God has manifested His grace in rescuing the ignorant, the sick, and the sorrowing, to become a matter of selfish merchandise? Shall God’s agency of blessing be used by those who profess to believe the truth, in buying and selling and getting gain? {SpTB01 20.1}"},{"t":7,"p":56,"c":"　　The experience of apostolic days will come to us if men will be worked by the Holy Spirit. The Lord will withdraw His blessing where selfish interests are indulged; but He will put His people in possession of good throughout the world, if they will unselfishly use their ability for the uplifting of humanity. His work is to be a sign of His benevolence, a sign that will win the confidence of the world and bring in resources for the advancement of the gospel. {SpTB01 20.2}"},{"t":7,"p":57,"c":"　　God will test the sincerity of men. Those who will deny self, take up the cross, and follow Christ, will have a continual work to do in the line of restoring. Those who sacrifice for truth make a deep impression on the world. Their example is contagious and convincing. Men see that there is in the church that faith which works by love and purifies the soul. But when those who profess to be working only for God seek to benefit themselves, they greatly retard the work, and cast reproach upon it. {SpTB01 20.3}"},{"t":7,"p":58,"c":"　　My brother, use every advantage possible to secure the salvation of souls. Never forsake the true standard, even though to cling to it makes you a beggar. God has set up a high standard of righteousness. He has made a plain distinction between human and divine wisdom. All who work on Christ’s side must work to save, not to destroy. Worldly policy is not to become the policy of the servants of God. Divine authority is to be acknowledged. The church on earth is to be the representative of heavenly principles. Amidst the awful confusion of injustice, deception, robbery, and crime, she is to shine with light from on high.

To those who set themselves up as accusers of their brethren comes this reprimand from God, “Who art thou that sittest as a judge? Get down from the judgment seat, and on your knees, with humility and contrition, confess your sins.” If this course of humiliation and confession is followed, the sure result will come.

In our efforts to help the sick, we are to take them away from the cities, where they are continually annoyed by the noise of trains and street cars, and where there is little besides houses to see, to places where they can be surrounded by the scenes of nature, and where they can have the blessing of fresh air and sunshine. {SpTB03a 6.4}"},{"t":7,"p":23,"c":"　　This subject was laid out before me in Australia.

We must study economy in the outlay of means. At this stage of our work, we are not to erect large buildings in any of the cities. And we are not to follow extravagant and unduly large plans in our work in any place. We are to remember the cities which have been neglected, and which must now be worked. The people in these cities must have the light of truth. In our establishment of sanitariums, we are not to spend large sums of money in the erection of costly buildings; for there are many places to be worked. We are to be wise in securing advantages already provided that the Lord desires us to have.

Connected with the place were gardens, in which the lady patients, when they chose, could cultivate flowers of every description, each patient selecting a special plot for which to care. Outdoor exercise in these gardens was prescribed as a part of the regular treatment. {SpTB03a 11.4}"},{"t":7,"p":47,"c":"　　Scene after scene passed before me.

The great question was, Can we get plenty of water by digging? {SpTB03c 18.2}"},{"t":7,"p":81,"c":"　　The well diggers had gone down eighty feet, and found a little water, but they wanted much more. O, how much depended upon our finding plenty of good, pure water! With an abundance of water, our work could go forward, but without it, what should we do? From the beginning I had felt the assurance that the Lord would open the way for our work to advance; but who could tell when and how? Our people were deeply desirous of seeing the sanitarium make a success, and as we met them, the question was, “Have you found water?” {SpTB03c 18.3}"},{"t":7,"p":82,"c":"　　While this important question was pending.

The next morning Brother Palmer came up early to tell me that there was fourteen feet of water in the well. The water is good and pure, and we are greatly rejoiced to know that there is an abundant supply. This well is a treasure more valuable than gold or silver or precious stones. {SpTB03c 19.3}"},{"t":7,"p":85,"c":"　　The workers at the sanitarium are all cheerful and hardworking. Every morning and evening they have a season of worship. For a day or two after reaching there, I met with them, an enjoyed the privilege very much.

At the beginning of our work, the manager heard of some furniture for sale by a family leaving the district. He went to see it, and found that they could obtain some first-class furniture for the same price they would have to pay for a cheaper grade.

I have had most precious seasons of refreshing in attending these services. A portion of scripture is read, then there is singing, and earnest prayers are offered that the great Medical Missionary will let His health-giving presence bring light and comfort and peace. I have had the privilege of speaking to those assembled at these seasons of worship, and I myself have been comforted in the effort to help and encourage others.

Everything at Loma Linda is fresh, wholesome, and attractive. The patients could live out of doors a large part of the time. The land will serve as a school for the education of patients.

Many are suffering as the result of hurtful practices, who might be restored to health if they would do what they might for their own restoration.

We have tried to follow closely the Lord’s directions in this matter, and He has let light shine on our pathway, as we have endeavored to establish sanitariums where sin-sick souls may be led to the great Healer.

Gifts, and loans at a low rate of interest, will be gladly received. My brethren, it is the Lord’s money that you are handling, and you can not invest it better than by putting it into the Lord’s work. Thus you will lay up treasure in heaven.

After the workers have wrestled all these years, shall those now connected with it give it up, and say they are beaten? We can not have it so. No such representation of our work is to be made before the world.

It has been presented to me that God wants the one institution to stand there, and He wants it to make progress.

Money was expended lavishly, in a way not in the order of God. And because of this, those who have come in to take charge of the institution have had to bear a severe test and trial. But when the burden and the test come, it is for us to ask what God means by the burden, and what He means by the test. There certainly is a work to be done by the Boulder Sanitarium, and a broad work to be done in the vicinity of this sanitarium. Laborers should be working all through that section of the country.

Young men and young women, who from their earliest years have been shielded from worldly associations, would thus be brought in contact with worldlings of all classes, and to a greater or less degree would be influenced by what they see and hear.

Just as long as the managers of the Sanitarium try to make Battle Creek a great center, so long will they call for men and women and ministers to do the work which they can not do. How can we encourage the plans to gather our youth into Battle Creek, when our heavenly Father has said that this place is not to be made a great center for educational work? Those educated there have not been receiving a training that will rightly prepare them to engage in the work of God. Seeds of doubt and of opposition to the Testimonies have been sown.

Now I repeat it. For years light has been coming to me that we should not center so much in one place. I have stated distinctly that an effort should not be made to make Battle Creek the sign and symbol of so much. The Lord is not very well pleased with Battle Creek. Not all that has been done in Battle Creek is well pleasing to him.

Certainly we did. I can speak for my husband as well as for myself. We prayed about the matter a great deal. So it was with the printing office, which was first established in a little wooden building. As the work grew, we had to add to it, and later, when ambitious men came in to take part in the management, more additions were made than should have been made, because these men thought that the buildings would give character to the work. That was a mistake. It is not buildings that give character to the work of God, but the faithfulness and integrity of the workers. {SpTB06 27.2}"},{"t":7,"p":69,"c":"　　The Sanitarium grew, and in 1887 Dr. Kellogg talked with me in regard to the necessity of having a hospital. I said, “Some months ago I was shown that we must have a hospital.” Our brethren did not know what had been presented to me about this, and the opposition came hard and strong. They sat right down upon Dr. Kellogg. I took my position close by his side, and told them that the light God had given me was that we should have a hospital in Battle Creek. The hospital was erected, and it was soon full of patients. {SpTB06 28.1}"},{"t":7,"p":70,"c":"　　Understand, brethren, that at that time we had not numerous sanitariums, as in later years we came to have.

I was in perfect union with this move. {SpTB06 28.3}"},{"t":7,"p":72,"c":"　　But of late some things have been brought in that I could not indorse, and one of these is the attaching of many enterprises and lines of medical work to the medical association in Battle Creek. The Lord showed me that this should not be done. Many here know what I said to them,—that we must not center so much in Battle Creek; that if we did not take heed, God’s judgments would visit Battle Creek. When I saw such an earnestness on the part of the leaders to connect all branches of the medical work with the association at Battle Creek, I told the brethren that the instruction given me was that they should not make the scratch of a pen to bind themselves to the restrictions of the rules and regulations that were arranged for them to come under. God wants his institutions to stand in fellowship with one another, just as brethren in the church should stand in fellowship. But they are never to be bound by written contracts to any one man or group of men. They are to stand in their own individuality, accountable to God. The Lord of heaven is to be the leader and guide and counselor of his people. His institutions are to be managed under his theocracy. His people are to act as a chosen people, a people who are to do a sacred and an unselfish work. {SpTB06 28.4}"},{"t":7,"p":73,"c":"　　When one institution gathers a large amount of responsibility and a large number of guests, the religious part of the work is in danger of being neglected. The managers of the Battle Creek Sanitarium have done nobly in the past in regard to trying to maintain a right religious influence in the Sanitarium. For a long time there were men connected with the institution whose work it was to hold Bible readings with the patients, as the way opened. Dr. Kellogg fully accorded with this. After the meeting at Minneapolis, Dr. Kellogg was a converted man, and we all knew it. We could see the converting power of God working in his heart and life. But as the institution has grown in popularity, there has been danger that the reason for which it was established would be lost sight of. Repeatedly I have given the instruction that was given to me,—that this institution should not be conducted after the manner in which worldly medical institutions are conducted; that pleasure-loving, card-playing, and theatrical performances should find no place in it. True piety was to be revealed in the lives of physicians and helpers. Everything connected with the institution was to speak in favor of the truth, and the truth in regard to the Sabbath would come to the patients. {SpTB06 29.1}"},{"t":7,"p":74,"c":"　　It was the piety of the workers, not the largeness of the buildings that was to bring conviction to hearts. Many souls have been converted; many wonderful cures have been wrought. The Lord has stood by the side of Dr. Kellogg as he performed difficult operations. When the doctor was overwrought by taxing labor, God understood the situation, and he put his hand on Dr. Kellogg’s hand as he operated, and through his power the operations were successful. {SpTB06 30.1}"},{"t":7,"p":75,"c":"　　I wish this to be understood. Over and over again I have encouraged Dr. Kellogg, telling him that the Lord God of Israel was at his right hand, to help him, and to give him success as he performed the difficult operations that meant life or death to the one operated upon. I told the doctor that before he took up his instruments to operate upon patients, he must pray for them. The patients saw that Dr. Kellogg was under the jurisdiction of God, that he understood his part to carry on the work successfully, and they had more confidence in him than in worldly physicians. {SpTB06 30.2}"},{"t":7,"p":76,"c":"　　God has given Dr. Kellogg the success that he has had. I have tried constantly to keep this before him, telling him that it was God who was working with him, and that the truth of God was to be magnified by his position.

God gave the light on health reform, and those who rejected it, rejected God. One and another who knew better, said that it all came from Dr. Kellogg, and they made war upon him. This had a bad influence on the doctor. He put on the coat of irritation and retaliation.

We have the authority of the Bible for our instruction in temperance. {SpTB06 31.3}"},{"t":7,"p":80,"c":"　　But God has nothing to do with making every other institution amenable in some way to the work and workers in Battle Creek. His servants should not be called upon to submit to rules and regulations for their fellow-men. God’s hand must hold every worker, and must guide and control every worker. Men are not to make rules for their fellow-men. The Bible has given the rules and regulations that we are to follow.

When the Sanitarium is placed on its proper foundation; when our people can see it as it was when it was first established; when they can understand that the institution belongs to the work of the Lord, and can see that no one man is to have the control of everything in it; then God will help them all to take hold with courage to build it up. Today you do not know just where it is. But God wants us to know every timber of the foundation, where it is, and what it is; then he wants us all to put shoulder to shoulder, and labor understandingly. The Lord wants us to do our duty. He wants us to understand that Dr. Kellogg shall not be pushed out of his place, but that he shall stand acknowledged and supported in his God-given work. This he will be if his feet are planted on the truth of the living God. If they are not planted on this truth, specious temptations will come in through scientific problems and scientific theories regarding God and his word. Spurious scientific theories are coming in as a thief in the night, stealing away the landmarks, and undermining the pillars of our faith. God has shown me that the medical students are not to be educated in such theories, because God will not indorse these theories. The most specious temptations of the enemy are coming in, and they are coming in on the highest, most elevated plane.

In his presentations he cloaked the matter somewhat, but in reality he was presenting as of the highest value, scientific theories which are akin to pantheism. {SpTB06 41.1}"},{"t":7,"p":106,"c":"　　After looking upon the pleased, interested countenances of those who were listening, One by my side told me that the evil angels had taken captive the mind of the speaker. He said that we were to stand as guardians of the churches, but that we were on no account to enter into discussion with those who hold pantheistic theories, on these subjects. He said that just as surely as the angels who fell were seduced and deceived by Satan, so surely was the speaker under the spiritualistic education of evil angels. {SpTB06 41.2}"},{"t":7,"p":107,"c":"　　I was astonished to see with what enthusiasm the sophistries and deceptive theories were received.

The matter has been working in his mind in such a way that he thinks he is to be the channel to infuse other minds with great light regarding certain scientific problems. Words and sentiments from my books will be taken and presented as being in harmony with his theories. But the Lord has forbidden us to enter into any discussion with him.... {SpTB06 42.1}"},{"t":7,"p":109,"c":"　　I am bidden to tell our ministers to enter into no discussion over these theories, but to let them alone.

His constant stream of talk confuses the minds of those he is seeking to influence. He mistakes and misquotes words, and places those who argue with him in so false a light that their powers of discernment are benumbed. He takes their words, and gives them an impress which makes them seem to mean exactly the opposite of what they said. {SpTB06 42.3}"},{"t":7,"p":111,"c":"　　If permitted, the evil angels will work the minds of men until they have no mind or will of their own. They are led as the angels cast out of heaven were led. Under Satan’s influence these angels uttered sentiments directly opposite to loyalty to God. Thus the family of God in heaven became corrupted. And thus will it be with physicians or ministers who continue to bind up with the one who has had light, who has had warnings, but who has not heeded them. At the Oakland Conference I was forbidden to have any conversation with him. I was not to place any writings in his hands; for he would read from these writings what I had not written, bringing in his own sentiments. {SpTB06 43.4}"},{"t":7,"p":112,"c":"　　God has given him opportunity after opportunity to place himself on vantage ground. As his feet were slipping down a precipice, Christ grasped his hands, saying, “Do not struggle. Hold fast to me.” Thus the Saviour has done again and again, to save him from making shipwreck of the faith. {SpTB06 43.1}"},{"t":7,"p":113,"c":"　　At the Berrien Springs meeting the Lord showed him special favor. God gave me power to present messages of admonition and encouragement. The two forces met, the Satanic influences and the influence of Christ. But Satan fought hard to hold his advantage, and he whom Christ sought to rescue is now in a more dangerous condition than before the meeting. Every ray of light rejected leaves him more surely fastened in Satan’s toils. {SpTB06 43.2}"},{"t":7,"p":114,"c":"　　I have no charge to make, no judgment of my own to give.

We are to have nothing to do with this deceptive branch of Satan’s work. The pleasing sentiments of pantheism will lead many souls into forbidden paths. God forbids his servants to leave their fields of labor to enter into a discussion of these sentiments. The last testimony published opens to our people the danger of these theories, and the testimonies published in the future will urge still more strongly the necessity of lifting up and carrying high the banner on which are inscribed the words, “The commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” God’s people are to let no one take this banner from their hands. I am instructed that false theories will be presented, and that some in the medical missionary work, who have been wavering, will yield up the faith, and give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. {SpTB06 43.4}"},{"t":7,"p":116,"c":"　　The only hope for our people now is to take their stand on the true foundation.

They retain the impression that the sin so hateful to God is a wonderful advantage. The sanctification that they claim, is polluted by the most seductive sin, which in their estimation is righteousness.

Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a spirit of genuine conversion was manifest. On every side, doors were thrown open to the proclamation of the truth. The world seemed to be lightened with a heavenly influence. Great blessings were received by the true and humble people of God. I heard voices of thanksgiving and praise, and there seemed to be a reformation such as we witnessed in 1844. Yet some refused to be converted. They were not willing to walk in God’s way.

Those who accept a position of responsibility in the cause of God should always remember that with the call to this work God has also called them to walk circumspectly before Him and before their fellow-men. Instead of considering it their duty to order and dictate and command, they should realize that they are to be learners themselves.

The promise of a Deliverer was given. “I will put enmity between thee and the woman,” God said to the serpent, “and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel.” Before they heard of the thorn and the thistle, of the sorrow and toil that must be their portion, or of the dust to which they must return, they listened to words that could not fail of giving them hope.

We need to have our faith strengthened. “Ask, and ye shall receive,” the Saviour promised; “seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” We need to educate ourselves to trust in this word, and to bring the light and grace of Christ into all our works.

Further than this, there are in Nashville large institutions for the education of the colored people, and our colored school is to be near enough to these institutions for the wing of their protection to be thrown over it. There is less inclination to oppress the colored people in this section of Tennessee than in many other parts of the South. Prejudice will not be so easily aroused. The institutions that have been established for the education of the colored people are richly endowed, and are in charge of white men. The presence of these institutions was one reason why Nashville was designated as the place in which the printing-office was to be established. I was instructed that the work in the South should have every advantage to print and publish books, that this work might gain a standing far ahead of that which it has had in the past. {SpTB11 6.2}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　Suggestions have been made by some that it might be well to sell our property in Huntsville, and move the school to some other place, but I have been instructed that this suggestion had its birth in unbelief. Our school in Huntsville is in a good location, and the large State Normal school for the training of colored teachers, which is carried on not far from there by those not of our faith, has created an influence in favor of educating the Negro, which our people should appreciate. We should have in Huntsville facilities for the education of a goodly number of students. We should have a primary school and a school for more advanced students. It would take years to build up in a new place the work that has already been done in Huntsville. {SpTB11 6.3}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　My soul is stirred within me as this matter is presented to me.

In an article published in The Review and Herald, August 18, 1904, I gave a description of this property, and an outline of proposed plans to be carried out in the operation of the school, as follows: {SpTB11 8.1}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　In connection with the work in Nashville, I wish to speak of the school work that Brethren Sutherland and Magan are planning to do. I was surprised when, in speaking of the work they wished to do in the South, they spoke of establishing a school in some place a long way from Nashville. From the light given me, I knew that this would not be the right thing to do, and I told them so. The work that these brethren can do, because of the experience gained at Berrien Springs, is to be carried on within easy access of Nashville; for Nashville has not yet been worked as it should be. And it will be a great blessing to the workers in the school to be near enough to Nashville to be able to counsel with the workers there. {SpTB11 8.2}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　In searching for a place for the school, the brethren found a farm of four hundred acres for sale, about nine miles from Nashville. The size of the farm, its situation, the distance that it is from Nashville, and the moderate sum for which it could be purchased, seemed to point it out as the very place for the school work. We advised that this place be purchased. I knew that all the land would ultimately be needed. For the work of the students, and to provide homes for the teachers, such land can be used advantageously. And as our work advances, a portion of this tract may be required for a country sanitarium. {SpTB11 8.3}"},{"t":7,"p":19,"c":"　　Other properties were examined, but we found nothing so well suited for our work. The price of the place, including standing crops, farm machinery, and over seventy head of cattle, was $12,723. It has been purchased, and as soon as possible, Brethren Magan and Sutherland, with a few experienced helpers, will begin school work there. We feel confident that the Lord has been guiding in this matter. {SpTB11 9.1}"},{"t":9,"p":19,"c":"Proposed Plans"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　The plan upon which our brethren propose to work is to select some of the best and most substantial young men and women from Berrien Springs and other places in the North, who believe that God has called them to the work in the South, and give them a brief training as teachers. Thorough instruction will be given in Bible study, physiology, and the history of our message; and special instruction in agriculture will be given. It is hoped that many of these students will eventually connect with schools in various places in the South. In connection with these schools there will be land that will be cultivated by teachers and students, and the proceeds from this work will be used for the support of the schools. {SpTB11 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　We went once more to see the farm, after its purchase had been completed, and were very much pleased with it. I earnestly hope that the school to be established there will be a success, and will help to build up the work of the Lord in that part of the vineyard. There are men of means in various parts of the land who can assist this enterprise by loans without interest, and by liberal gifts. {SpTB11 9.3}"},{"t":7,"p":22,"c":"　　Let us sustain Brethren Sutherland and Magan in their efforts to advance this important work. They gained a valuable experience in Berrien Springs, and the providence of God has led them to feel that they must labor in the Southern field. God helped them constantly in their efforts at Berrien Springs, as they steadily advanced, determined that obstacles should not stop the work. They are not leaving Berrien Springs because of dissension or strife. They are not fleeing from duty. They are leaving a place where a school has been established, to go to a new field, where the work may be much harder. They have only means enough to pay part of the price of the land. They should not be left to struggle along misunderstood and unaided, at the sacrifice of health. {SpTB11 10.1}"},{"t":7,"p":23,"c":"　　As these brethren go to the South to take hold of pioneer work in a difficult field, we ask our people to make their work as effective as possible by assisting them in the establishment of the new school near Nashville. {SpTB11 10.2}"},{"t":7,"p":24,"c":"　　I ask our people to help the work in the Southern field by aiding Brethren Sutherland and Magan and their faithful associates in the carrying forward of the important enterprise they have undertaken.

There is a great work to be done in that field, and we ask you to act your part. {SpTB11 10.3}"},{"t":4,"p":24,"c":"Chapter 4—A Country Sanitarium"},{"t":7,"p":25,"c":"　　Early in the history of the Madison school, it was suggested that a sanitarium might be established on a portion of the property purchased for the school farm. In letters written to those in charge of medical missionary work in the Southern States, I pointed out the advantages that are gained by establishing a training school and a sanitarium in close proximity. These letters were written in the fall of 1904, and, a year later, the principles set forth in this correspondence were incorporated in an article, and sent to the brethren assembled in a Medical Missionary Convention at College View, Neb., November 21-26, 1905. {SpTB11 11.1}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　The article is as follows: {SpTB11 11.2}"},{"t":9,"p":26,"c":"Co-operation Between Schools and Sanitariums"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　I have been instructed that there are decided advantages to be gained by the establishment of a school and a sanitarium in close proximity, that they may be a help one to the other. Instruction regarding this was given to me when we were making decisions about the location of our buildings in Takoma Park. Whenever it is possible to have a school and a sanitarium near enough together for helpful co-operation between the two institutions, and yet separated sufficiently to prevent one from interfering with the work of the other, let them be located so as to carry on their work in conjunction. One institution will give influence and strength to the other; and, too, money can be saved by both institutions, because each can share the advantages of the other. {SpTB11 11.3}"},{"t":7,"p":28,"c":"　　In connection with our larger schools there should be provided facilities for giving many students thorough instruction regarding gospel medical missionary work. This line of work is to be brought into our colleges and training-schools as a part of the regular instruction. This will make it unnecessary for our youth from all parts of the land to go to Battle Creek, or to any other one or two places, to obtain a thorough and satisfactory education and training. {SpTB11 12.1}"},{"t":7,"p":29,"c":"　　Those in training to be nurses and physicians should daily be given instruction that will develop the highest motives for advancement. They should attend our colleges and training-schools; and the teachers in these institutions of learning should realize their responsibility to work with and pray with the students. In these schools, students should learn to be true medical missionaries, firmly bound up with the gospel ministry. {SpTB11 12.2}"},{"t":7,"p":30,"c":"　　Our people who have a deep interest in the children and youth, and in the training of laborers to carry forward the work essential for this time, need not be left in perplexity and uncertainty about the steps to be taken for the training of their youth as medical missionaries. God will open ways before all who humbly seek Him for wisdom in the perfecting of Christian character. He will have places ready for them in which to begin to do genuine missionary work. It is to prepare laborers for this work that our schools and sanitariums are established. {SpTB11 12.3}"},{"t":7,"p":31,"c":"　　For the strengthening of this line of effort, counsel has been given that in connection with our larger schools there should be established small sanitariums. Whenever a well-equipped sanitarium is located near a school, it may add greatly to the strength of the medical missionary course in the school, if the managers establish perfect co-operation between the two institutions. The teachers in the school can help the workers in the sanitarium by their advice and counsel, and by sometimes speaking to the patients. And, in return, those in charge of the sanitarium can assist in training for field service the students who are desirous of becoming medical missionaries. Circumstances, of course, must determine the details of the arrangements that it will be best to make. As the workers in each institution plan unselfishly to help one another, the blessing of the Lord will surely rest upon both institutions. {SpTB11 12.4}"},{"t":7,"p":32,"c":"　　No one man, whether a teacher, a physician, or a minister, can ever hope to be a complete whole. God has given to every man certain gifts, and has ordained that men be associated in His service, in order that the varied talents of many minds may be blended. The contact of mind with mind tends to quicken thought and increase the capabilities. The deficiencies of one laborer are often made up by the special gifts of another; and as physicians and teachers thus associated unite in imparting their knowledge, the youth under their training will receive a symmetrical, well-balanced education for service. {SpTB11 13.1}"},{"t":7,"p":33,"c":"　　In all these efforts, there will come many opportunities for manifesting gentlemanly courtesy. The Christian is always courteous. And by association with his fellow-workers, he becomes more and more refined. He learns to overlook little points of difference regarding questions that are of no vital consequence. Such a man, when in charge of one of the Lord’s institutions, is willing to deny self and to yield his personal opinions on matters of minor importance, in order that, with all brotherly kindness, he may co-operate heartily with the managers of another institution near by. He will not hesitate to speak plainly and firmly when occasion demands; but his every word and act will be mingled with a courtesy so kindly, so Christlike, that no offense can be taken. Powerful is the influence for good that is exercised by a consecrated, active Christian gentleman. And when the managers of our institutions in close proximity learn to unite their forces, and to labor unselfishly and untiringly for the upbuilding of one another’s work, the results for good are far-reaching. {SpTB11 13.2}"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　The benefits of hearty co-operation extend beyond physicians and teachers, students and sanitarium helpers. When a sanitarium is built near a school, those in charge of the educational institution have a grand opportunity of setting a right example before those who all through life have been easy-going idlers, and who have come to the sanitarium for treatment. The patients will see the contrast between the idle, self-indulgent life that they have lived, and the life of self-denial and service lived by Christ’s followers. They will learn that the object of medical missionary work is to restore, to correct wrongs, to show human beings how to avoid the self-indulgence that brings disease and death. {SpTB11 14.1}"},{"t":7,"p":35,"c":"　　The words and actions of the workers in the sanitarium and in the school plainly reveal that life is an intensely solemn thing, in view of the account which all must render to God. Each one should now put his talents out to the exchangers, adding to the Master’s gift, blessing others with the blessings given him. At the day of judgment, the life-work of each one is investigated, and each one receives a reward proportionate to his efforts. {SpTB11 15.1}"},{"t":7,"p":36,"c":"　　That the best results may be secured by the establishment of a sanitarium near a school, there needs to be perfect harmony between the workers in both institutions. This is sometimes difficult to secure, especially when teachers and physicians are inclined to be self-centered, each considering as of the greatest importance the work with which he is most closely connected. When men who are self-confident are in charge of institutions in close proximity, great annoyance might result were each determined to carry out his own plans, refusing to make concessions to others. Both those at the head of the sanitarium and those at the head of the school will need to guard against clinging tenaciously to their own ideas concerning things that are really nonessentials. {SpTB11 15.2}"},{"t":7,"p":37,"c":"　　There is a great work to be done by our sanitariums and schools. Time is short. What is done must be done quickly. Let those who are connected with these important instrumentalities be wholly converted. Let them not live for self, for worldly purposes, withholding themselves from full consecration to God’s service. Let them give themselves, body, soul, and spirit, to God, to be used by Him in saving souls. They are not at liberty to do with themselves as they please; they belong to God; for He has bought them with the life-blood of His only-begotten Son. And as they learn to abide in Christ, there will remain in the heart no room for selfishness. In His service they will find the fullest satisfaction. {SpTB11 15.3}"},{"t":7,"p":38,"c":"　　Let this be taught and lived by medical missionary workers. Let these laborers tell those with whom they come in contact that the life that men and women now live will one day be examined by a just God, and that each one must now do his best, offering to God consecrated service. Those in charge of the school are to teach the students to use for the highest, holiest purpose the talents God has given them, that they may accomplish the greatest good in this world. Students need to learn what it means to have a real aim in life, and to obtain an exalted understanding of what true education means. They need to learn what it means to be true gospel medical missionaries,—missionaries who can go forth to labor with the ministers of the Word in needy fields. {SpTB11 16.1}"},{"t":7,"p":39,"c":"　　Wherever there is a favorable opportunity, let our sanitariums and our schools plan to be a help and a strength to each other. The Lord would have His work move forward solidly. Let light shine forth as God designed that it should from His institutions, and let God be glorified and honored. This is the purpose and plan of heaven in the establishment of these institutions.

The forty acres of land, with the large buildings located on the property, are in the midst of the Middlesex Fells, a State reservation of three thousand five hundred acres. We have driven slowly through the park in every direction, looking with delight at the trees and the lakes, and inhaling the health-giving fragrance of the pines. It is delightful to ride through the forest. There are many beautiful drives, and much fine scenery. I enjoy looking at the many different kinds of trees, but most of all I enjoy looking at the noble pines. There are medicinal properties in the fragrance of these trees. “Life, life,” my husband used to say when riding among the pines. “Breathe deep, Ellen; fill your lungs with the fragrant, life-giving atmosphere.” {SpTB13 5.1}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　It is impossible to find words to describe the beauty of this place.

In the early history of our work, many were healed by prayer. And some, after they were healed, pursued the same course in the indulgence of appetite that they had followed in the past. They did not live and work in such a way as to avoid sickness. They did not show that they appreciated the Lord’s goodness to them. Again and again they were brought to suffering through their own careless, thoughtless course of action. How could the Lord be glorified in bestowing on them the gift of health? {SpTB13 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":24,"c":"　　When the light came that we should begin sanitarium work, the reasons were plainly given.

As a part of the treatment, lectures were to be given on right habits of eating and drinking and dressing.

Many of the patients will be led to keep the body in the most healthy condition possible, because it is the Lord’s purchased possession. “Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” {SpTB13 9.4}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　When we have shown the people that we have right principles regarding health reform, we should then take up the temperance question in all its bearings, and drive it home to the hilt. {SpTB13 10.1}"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　It is to save the souls, as well as to cure the bodies, of men and women, that at much expense our sanitariums are established.

He designs that they shall be educated in right habits of living, spiritual and physical. The salvation of many souls is at stake. In the providence of God, many of the sick are to be given the opportunity of separating for a time from harmful associations and surroundings, and of placing themselves in institutions where they may receive health-restoring treatments and wise instruction from Christian nurses and physicians.

Potts about twenty years ago. After being used for a few months, it lay idle for many years, and was then offered for sale at twenty thousand dollars, with encouragement that it might be purchased for fifteen thousand dollars cash. {SpTB14 8.1}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　In September, 1902, after the Los Angeles camp-meeting, we spent a week in San Diego, and visited several places that were offered us for sanitarium work. In the building offered us by Mrs. Potts, it seemed to me we found about all that we could ask. Here was a well-constructed, three-story building of about fifty rooms, with broad verandas, standing upon a pleasant rise of ground, and overlooking a beautiful valley. Many of the rooms are large and airy.... {SpTB14 8.2}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　Besides the main building, there is a good stable, and also a six-room cottage, which can be fitted up for helpers. The property is conveniently located, being less than seven miles from San Diego, and about a mile from the National City post-office. {SpTB14 8.3}"},{"t":7,"p":22,"c":"　　There are twenty-two acres of land. ［Since increased to thirty.] About one-half of this had once been planted to fruit-trees, but during the long drought that this country has suffered, all the trees died except the ornamental trees and shrubbery around the buildings, and about seventy olive-trees on the terraces. {SpTB14 8.4}"},{"t":7,"p":23,"c":"　　When we learned that the agents holding this property, becoming discouraged on account of the many years of drought, were offering it for twelve thousand dollars, I said to our brethren, “I believe that the Lord has kept this place for us, and that He will open the way for us to secure it. I never saw a building offered for sale that was better adapted for sanitarium work. If this place were fixed up, it would look just like places that have been shown me by the Lord.” {SpTB14 9.1}"},{"t":7,"p":24,"c":"　　A year before, light had been given me that our people in Southern California must watch for opportunities to purchase such properties, and it seemed plain to me and to those who were with me that the opportunity of securing this place was a fulfilment of the encouragement given us, and published in the “Testimonies for the Church,” Volume VII, in the following words: {SpTB14 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":25,"c":"　　“As soon as possible, sanitariums are to be established in different places in Southern California. Let a beginning be made in several places. If possible, let land be purchased on which buildings are already erected. Then, as the prosperity of the work demands, let appropriate enlargement be made.... In Southern California there are many properties for sale on which buildings suitable for sanitarium work are already erected. Some of these properties should be purchased, and medical missionary work be carried forward on sensible, rational lines. Several small sanitariums are to be established in Southern California, for the benefit of the multitudes drawn there in the hope of finding health. Instruction has been given me that now is our opportunity to reach the invalids flocking to the health resorts of Southern California.” {SpTB14 9.3}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　In December we learned that this place could be purchased for eleven thousand dollars, and I encouraged Dr. Whitelock to take steps to secure it.

The orchards were dying. In January, 1904, Dr. Whitelock wrote to me that the mortgages could be bought for six thousand dollars, and perhaps less. Again I advised our brethren connected with the medical work in Southern California to secure the place. But I learned that they were not prepared to act. Then I laid the matter before Sister Gotzian, and she consented to join me in securing the place. Then we telegraphed an offer of four thousand dollars for the mortgages. Two days later a telegram returned accepting the offer. Meanwhile a letter from other parties in San Diego was on its way to New York, offering six thousand dollars for the mortgages. {SpTB14 10.3}"},{"t":7,"p":29,"c":"　　Shortly after we had secured the place, Elder and Mrs. J. F. Ballenger joined us in raising the amount to be paid for the property. {SpTB14 10.4}"},{"t":7,"p":30,"c":"　　Having secured the place, we needed a manager, and we found one ready for the work.

The building had been thoroughly repaired, inside and out, and painted outside. It had been fitted up with electric lights, and about one third of the rooms were furnished. By taking advantage of several sales of furniture by wealthy families leaving the country, first-class furniture had been secured at very low prices. {SpTB14 11.1}"},{"t":7,"p":32,"c":"　　Our great anxiety about the place was the matter of an ample supply of water. Years ago, when the valley was prosperous, it depended upon the water of the mountain streams stored up by great dams, but as the result of the many years of drought, there was no water in the reservoirs to supply our needs. Some of our neighbors in the valley had good wells, but our place was a little to one side. The great question was, Can we get plenty of water by digging? {SpTB14 11.2}"},{"t":7,"p":33,"c":"　　The well-diggers had gone down eighty feet, and found a little water, but they wanted much more. O how much depended upon our finding plenty of good, pure water! With an abundance of water our work could go forward, but without it, what should we do? From the beginning, I had felt the assurance that the Lord would open the way; but who could tell when and how? Our people were deeply desirous of seeing the sanitarium make a success, and as we met them, the question was, “Have you found water? {SpTB14 11.3}"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　While this important question was pending, Professor E. S. Ballenger and my son went to San Pasqual and Escondido to present to our people the encouragements that had attended the enterprise thus far, and the plan of organization that had been prepared, and to ask for their help. {SpTB14 12.1}"},{"t":7,"p":35,"c":"　　All were glad to share the burden of making this sanitarium, as far as possible, a San Diego County enterprise, and they gave freely according to their ability. About fifteen hundred dollars was subscribed, and half of this was brought back for immediate use. {SpTB14 12.2}"},{"t":7,"p":36,"c":"　　The very day of the return of Professor Ballenger and my son, with the evidence of the hearty, practical support of the people, the workers in the well struck a fine stream of good, pure water. The next morning Brother Palmer came up early to tell me that there was fourteen feet of water in the well. The water is clear and pure, and we are greatly rejoiced to know that there is an abundant supply. This well is a treasure more valuable than gold or silver or precious stones. {SpTB14 12.3}"},{"t":7,"p":37,"c":"　　One morning a lady came to the sanitarium unannounced, and insisted upon staying. Others arrived before we were ready, and patients continued to come till there were twenty, and our workers were kept so busy that the formal opening was postponed indefinitely. {SpTB14 12.4}"},{"t":7,"p":38,"c":"　　One evening just before we left, a four-horse team drawing a large, heavy wagon, drove in, bringing gifts to the sanitarium from San Pasqual. In the load there were potatoes, squash, and canned fruit, and also, in the same wagon, two beautiful Jersey cows. {SpTB14 12.5}"},{"t":7,"p":39,"c":"　　During the last three nights of my stay at this institution, much instruction was given me regarding the sanitariums which for years have been greatly needed, and which should long ago have been equipped and set in working order.

In the winter of 1903-04, when the way opened up for us to purchase the Paradise Valley Sanitarium property, about six miles from San Diego, a few brethren and sisters at first bore the entire financial burden.

During my visit to Southern California, light was given me that many of the leaders in our sanitariums were failing of meeting the requirements of God, and, more than this, they did not realize their lack. I was instructed that those who stand in positions of responsibility in these important institutions are engaged in a most sacred work, that they have little time in which to do the work committed to their trust, and that it was of the utmost importance that faithfulness and consecration mark their efforts in every line. {SpTB15 1.1}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　In a remarkable way God has brought into our possession some of the institutions through whose agency we are to accomplish the work of reformation to which as a people we are called.

The instruction of the apostle Peter, “Add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge,” they are to bring into their individual experience, and this work of daily sanctification through cooperation with the Spirit of God, will develop their knowledge and capabilities. {SpTB15 1.3}"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　In ancient times the Lord worked in a wonderful way through consecrated women who united in His work with men whom He had chosen to stand as His representatives. He used women to gain great and decisive victories. More than once, in times of emergency, He brought them to the front and worked through them for the salvation of many lives. Through Esther the queen, the Lord accomplished a mighty deliverance for his people. At a time when it seemed that no power could save them, Esther and the women associated with her, by fasting and prayer and prompt action, met the issue, and brought salvation to their people. {SpTB15 1.4}"},{"t":7,"p":7,"c":"　　A study of women’s work in connection with the cause of God in Old Testament times will teach us lessons that will enable us to meet emergencies in the work today. We may not be brought into such a critical and prominent place as were the people of God in the time of Esther; but often converted women can act an important part in more humble positions. This many have been doing, and are still ready to do. It is a woman’s duty to unite with her husband in the discipling ［disciplining] and training of her sons and daughters, that they may be converted, and their powers consecrated to the service of God. There are many who have ability to stand with their husbands in sanitarium work, to give treatments to the sick and to speak words of counsel and encouragement to others. There are those who should seek an education that will fit them to act the part of physicians. {SpTB15 2.1}"},{"t":7,"p":8,"c":"　　In this line of service a positive work needs to be done. Women as well as men are to receive a thorough medical training. They should make a special study of diseases common to women, that they may understand how to treat them. It is considered most essential that men desiring to practice medicine shall receive the broad training necessary for the following of such a profession. It is just as essential that women receive such training, and obtain their diplomas certifying their right to act as physicians. {SpTB15 2.2}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　Our institutions should be especially thorough in giving to women a training that will fit them to act as midwives. There should be in our sanitariums lady physicians who understand well their profession, and who can attend women at the time of childbirth. Light has been given me that women instead of men should take the responsibility in such cases. I was directed to the Bible plan, in which at such times women acted the part of the physician. This plan should be carried out by us; for it is the Lord’s plan. {SpTB15 2.3}"},{"t":7,"p":10,"c":"　　Again and again light has been given me that women should be chosen and educated for this line of work. Now the time has come when we should face the matter clearly. More women should be educated for this work, and thus a door of temptation may be closed.

We need to pray and to consider earnestly what is the great spiritual need of men and women in this age. Strange things are being done, which are not after the Lord’s counsel, but after the devising of men. As wicked practices increase among those who are determined to do wickedly, there is great need that our people bring into prominence before the world a pure untainted work. The Lord says to us, Be ye clean that labor in the health institutions. Work under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God. Let the men holding positions of sacred trust view the work from a high standpoint. {SpTB15 3.3}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　I ask you who stand as leaders in this work to read prayerfully chapters four to eleven of the book of Deuteronomy, for there is instruction that all need who would understand God’s dealings with His people. And I wish to impress upon all who read these chapters that they mean much to every soul who carries responsibilities in connection with sanitarium work. “Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God,” the Lord declares, “and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself above all nations that are upon the earth.” All the directions He has given are to be carefully observed, from the greatest to that which may seem the least. {SpTB15 3.4}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　The Lord says to all, Purify your souls from all commonness.

Behold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens is the Lord’s thy God, the earth also, and all that therein is. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.” Read these words thoughtfully, and consider how great are the privileges of the people whom the Lord chose to serve Him. To all connected with sacred duties I am charged to say, Seek the Lord. Take heed to your conversation; lay off all cheapness of speech, for the Lord would have you become intelligent workers and wise counselors. Let those with whom you associate see nothing of frivolity in your words and works. You have the knowledge of sacred truth, and you are to honor those truths as men and women who must give an account for the talents entrusted to them. {SpTB15 4.2}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　God would have His honor exalted before men as supreme, and His counsels confirmed in the eyes of the people. The witness of the prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel gives the example of one who stood wholly for God and His work in the earth. The prophet calls the Lord by His name, Jehovah God, which He Himself had given to denote His condescension and compassion. Elijah calls Him the God of Abraham and Isaac and Israel. He does this that he may excite in the hearts of his backslidden people humble remembrance of the Lord, and assure them of His rich free grace. Elijah prays, “Be it known this day that thou art the Lord God of Israel.” The honor of God is to be exalted as supreme, but the prophet asks further that his mission also may be confirmed. “Let it be known that thou art God in Israel,” he prays, “and that I am thy servant, and have done all things at thy word.” “Hear me, O Lord,” he pleads, “hear me.” {SpTB15 4.3}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　Elijah is intense.

They would still remain the prophets of Baal. Thus they showed themselves ripe for destruction. And Elijah said to the people, “Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” The time had come when delusion was unveiled. The people saw the awful deception that had been practiced upon them by the false prophets; and when the word was spoken, they fell upon the prophets, brought them down to the brook Kishon, and took part in their slaughter. Thus was Elijah’s faith crowned with victory, the priests of Baal put to shame, and the worshipers of false gods confounded. {SpTB15 5.3}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　Elijah’s whole life was devoted to the work of reform.

His zeal for God’s glory and his deep love for the house of Israel present lessons for the instruction of all who stand today as representatives of God’s work in the earth. Let the conductors of our institutional work catch the spirit of zeal felt by Elijah and learn its intensity.

If this is to be accomplished, those who bear responsibilities here must in character and deportment properly represent the solemn, sacred work with which they are connected. All should realize that the work must stand on a higher plane. Let no cheapness in conversation be indulged in, but let all realize that God requires solemnity in all who stand in this work. {SpTB15 6.4}"},{"t":7,"p":25,"c":"　　This is a testimony similar to that I have borne in many places where carelessness in words and spirit have been manifest, revealing a low spiritual standard. God wants to work through ministers, through physicians, and through all connected with sanitarium work; and there will be a great work done here when all cheapness and frivolity are put away. In a marvelous way God has worked to give us this and other similar institutions; but it is represented to me that these institutions are not reaching the high standard that God requires them to reach. The workers can not attain this of themselves, but God can give them the right mold of character if they feel the necessity of looking to Him and holding fast to His promises. {SpTB15 7.1}"},{"t":7,"p":26,"c":"　　The message borne to us by the apostle Peter is, “Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.

And this experience manifested in the life of the workers will make upon the minds of those who come into the institution, impressions for good which will be carried away with them. The light of heaven will come in, and it will shine into the hearts and minds of unbelievers, making impressions that will be a lasting influence for good in their lives. {SpTB15 7.3}"},{"t":7,"p":28,"c":"　　In many places where I go to visit our health institutions this instruction is repeated to me, because our workers need to climb higher.

There is no safety for any man, young or old, unless he feels the necessity of seeking counsel of God at every step. Those only who maintain a close communion with God will learn to place His estimate upon men, to reverence the pure, the good, the humble, the meek. The heart must be garrisoned as was that of Joseph. Then temptations to depart from integrity will be met with decision; ‘How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?’ The strongest temptation is no excuse for sin. No matter how severe the pressure brought to bear upon you, sin is your own act. The seat of the difficulty is the unrenewed heart. {SpTB16 14.1}"},{"t":7,"p":46,"c":"　　“A man who claims to have believed present truth for years and is counted worthy by his brethren to fill positions of trust in our missions or in our institutions, may become careless when a change of circumstances brings him into temptations, and in his time he may tempt others. His case is sad indeed, for he reveals the workings of a corrupt heart, a want of that principle which every Christian should possess. When one who is intrusted with great responsibilities betrays his sacred trust and gives himself into the hands of Satan as an instrument of unrighteousness to sow the seeds of evil, corrupting the hearts and minds of others, he is a traitor of the worst type. From one such tainted, polluted mind the youth often receive the first impure thoughts that lead to a life of shame and defilement. {SpTB16 14.2}"},{"t":7,"p":47,"c":"　　“If men placed at the head of a mission have not firmness of principle that will preserve them from every vestige of commonness, and unbecoming familiarity with young girls and women, after the light which has been so plainly given, let them be discharged without a second trial. There is a depravity of the soul which leads to these careless habits and practices, and which will overbalance all the good such persons can do. We are living in an age of moral debasement; the world is as a second Sodom. Those who look for the coming of the Son of Man, those who know that they are right upon the borders of the eternal world, should set an example in harmony with their faith. Those who do not maintain purity and holiness are not accepted of God. The true children of God have deep-rooted principles which will not be moved by temptations, because Christ is abiding in their hearts by faith. {SpTB16 15.1}"},{"t":7,"p":48,"c":"　　“A second trial would be of no avail to those whose moral sense is so perverted that they can not see their danger. If after they have long held the truth, if sanctifying power has not established the character in piety, virtue, and purity, let them be disconnected with the missions without delay; for through these Satan will insinuate the same lax sentiments in the minds of those who ought to have an example of virtue and moral dignity. Anything that approaches love-sick sentimentalism, any intimation of commonness should be decidedly rebuked. One who is guilty of encouraging this improper familiarity should not only be relieved of responsibilities which he was unworthy to bear, but should be placed under censure of the church, and that censure should remain upon him until he give evidence in spirit and deportment, that he sees the sinfulness and heart corruption, and repents, like any other guilty sinner, and is converted. Then God for Christ’s sake will heal him of his transgression. {SpTB16 15.2}"},{"t":7,"p":49,"c":"　　“Even though the men and women at the head of our missions are in character as pure as fine gold, they need constant connection with God in order to keep themselves pure and to know how to manage the youth discreetly, so that all shall keep their thoughts untainted, uncorrupted. Let the lessons be of an elevated, ennobling character, that the mind may be filled with pure and noble thoughts. ‘Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as He (God) is pure.’ As God is pure in His sphere, so man is to be pure in his. And he will be pure if Christ is formed within, the hope of glory; for he will imitate Christ’s life and reflect His character. {SpTB16 15.3}"},{"t":7,"p":50,"c":"　　“When a conference selects young men and women, and aids them in obtaining an education for the canvassing field or any other branch of the work, there should be an understanding as to what they propose to do—whether they design to engage in courtship and marriage, or to labor for the advancement of the cause of truth. It is no use to spend time and money in the education of workers who will fall in love before they complete this education, and who can not resist the first temptation in the form of an invitation to marriage. In most cases the labor spent on such persons is wholly lost. When they enter the marriage relation, their usefulness in the work of God is at an end. They increase their family, they are dwarfed and crippled in every way, and can not use the knowledge they have obtained. {SpTB16 16.1}"},{"t":7,"p":51,"c":"　　“Before persons are admitted to our mission training schools, let there be a written agreement that after receiving their education they will give themselves to the work for a specified time.

Those who are controlled by a sense of duty, who daily seek wisdom and help from God, will act intelligently, not from selfish motives, but from the love of Christ and the truth. Such will not hesitate to give themselves unreservedly, soul, body, and spirit, to the work. They will study, work, and pray for its advancement. I repeat, do not enter into a marriage engagement, unless there are good and sufficient reasons for this step,—unless the work of God can be better advanced thereby. For Christ’s sake deny inclination, lift the cross, and do the work for which you are educating yourselves. {SpTB16 16.2}"},{"t":7,"p":52,"c":"　　“Many of the marriages contracted in these last days prove to be a mistake. The parties make no advancement in spiritual things; their growth and usefulness ended with their marriage.

Did the Lord urge them to obtain the advantages of our schools and missions, that they might sink everything in courtship and marriage, binding themselves by a human band for a lifetime? By accepting the work of rearing children in these last days of uncertainty and peril, many place themselves in a position where they can not labor either in the canvassing field or in any other branch of the cause of God, and some lose all interest to do this. They are content with a common, low level, and assimilate to the position they have chosen. The bewitching power of Satan’s deception wrought within the human heart its evil work. Instead of candidly considering the time in which we live, and the work they might do in leading others to the truth they reason from a selfish standpoint, and follow the impulse of their own unconsecrated hearts. ‘The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.’ The natural appetites and passions become a controlling power, and the result is that spiritual growth ceases; the soul is, as it were, paralyzed. {SpTB16 17.1}"},{"t":7,"p":53,"c":"　　“Let none who dedicate themselves to the work of God be discouraged at the outlook, but let them strive to be faithful in the work committed to them.

If you are careless and inattentive, reckless of your words, reckless in spirit, your character is thus portrayed by the recording angel. As the polished plate of the artist produces your features, so will the books of records reflect your words, your works, your character. If you cease to do evil, if you learn to do well, through the grace given for you, the golden harvest of infinite blessedness is growing, and as a laborer together with God you are preparing to be a reaper.

The sinful nature is to be kept under the control of the Spirit of God. The transforming grace of Christ will bring the will into harmony with the will of Christ. The more closely we are brought into unity with Christ, the more clearly we shall discern the defects of our character. It is marvelous how deceptive is the human heart, how easily self-deluded, how easily led into sin.

There our brethren thought they were going to secure a very rich mine. And they kept at it and at it, investing money, and more money. I told them that it would not amount to anything, because they were not working after the Lord’s plan; ... that they were drawing the minds of the people away from the truths that the Lord would have them dwell upon.

As a people we are to be wide-awake to the devices of the enemy, and take a sensible course. We are not to allow ourselves to be caught by the spirit of the world, where every scheme is being laid for the making of money, and where life is counted of little value. Let our people at this time consecrate themselves wholly to the Lord, and walk humbly with Him. They are to unite with heavenly beings for the upbuilding of the kingdom of Christ in the earth.

He could not do this and honor the sacred truths of His word. By the course you adopt, the precious truth regarding God’s guidance of His people is cheapened, and the spiritual experience lowered to the level of common things. Those who follow manmade tests to decide their duty, will bring into their experience that which will destroy their pure faith in the Word, a practical knowledge of the teachings of which every soul must have who would perfect his Christian character. {SpTB17a 35.1}"},{"t":7,"p":105,"c":"　　The Lord has shown me that your religious experience is becoming a matter of chance. It savors of gambling. I beseech you that you let this experience go no farther. You are educating church-members to think it a virtue to obtain money in a way that should not be admitted among us.

Should the fallacies that you are following be accepted as coming from the Lord, many honest souls would be deceived and drawn into temptation, because they are led away from trusting in the Lord’s plan for the assurance of eternal life.

I am intensely anxious that our people shall not be corrupted by your commercial spirit and by your representations regarding the Lord’s methods of guidance. God condemns the spirit of chance that is revealed in your work. He forbids that we give such a lesson, by precept or example, to any souls, believers or unbelievers; for it is an evil that will spoil the experience of all who allow its principles to rule. {SpTB17a 36.2}"},{"t":7,"p":109,"c":"　　It is dishonoring to God for men to make such radical movements as you have made without any higher direction than you have had. You rejoice at the outlook as if you knew that the Lord stood by your side to guide your hand as you make your test. But this is not the method by which matters of eternal interest are to be decided. Rather it is one of Satan’s schemes for binding about the work of God. Let not the idea be entertained that any form of chance work is the dictation of the Holy Spirit; I know it is not. I can speak decidedly regarding this, for I know whereof I speak. The act of tossing up a piece of silver to gain a knowledge of duty, shows the judgment of a man who needs to come to God in confession, and in simplicity and faith to seek the Lord for true guidance.... {SpTB17a 36.3}"},{"t":7,"p":110,"c":"　　A right acceptance of the principles of truth will always result in transformation of character. Christians need to study well the character of Christ, that their lives may be cleansed from sin, and fashioned after the perfect life of Christ. In the home and in the church the converting power of God is needed. The Lord requires that every professing Christian shall be self-denying and self-sacrificing. It is not possible to receive and obey the words of Christ without having the character conformed to the likeness of Christ. If we are wearing Christ’s yoke, we shall be meek and lowly as Christ was.

How does it appear, think you, to Christ and heavenly beings, for those who have divine power at their command to resort for guidance to the chance result of the tossing up of a piece of silver? Satan works to control such actions to carry out his purposes, and he rejoices when he is given opportunity of doing so. Let us as a people break every yoke. The Spirit of the Lord must work decidedly to refine and cleanse and sanctify, that every human obstruction may be removed. Human judgment must be brought into perfect accord with a “Thus saith the Lord.” {SpTB17a 38.1}"},{"t":7,"p":113,"c":"　　There is no chance work with God in the directing of His people.

The brethren considered the matter and felt favorable to its purchase. As sister White also favored it, the land was purchased at less than $100 an acre. Since that time we have several times been offered $300 an acre for a portion of it. {SpTB17b 4.1}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　Shortly afterward, sister White visited Loma Linda and asked to see the piece of property we had purchased. As she viewed it from the top of the sanitarium building for some little time, she said, “Well, we are thankful we have it,” But turning and looking north she waved her hand in front of the building and said, “The Angel said, ‘get all of it’.” On remarking to sister White how difficult it had been to secure what we already had, she simply said. “Well, we shall be thankful for what we have,” and turned and went to her room. {SpTB17b 4.2}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　We did not know how much was included in her remark, “Get all of it,” But supposed she referred to the kelly tracts in front of the sanitarium on which we had secured prices when we first purchased Loma Linda, and on which we had really held an option for a time, thinking possibly the brethren might consider purchasing a portion of these tracts. {SpTB17b 4.3}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　One tract of one hundred and fifty acres lying west of pepper drive (Loma Linda Avenue), between the southern pacific railway and colton Avenue, was held at $18,000.

The next tract, twenty-seven acres, lying east of pepper drive, running from the Creek to Colton Avenue, was held at $2,250. Another three-corner tract of about twenty acres, lying north of the southern pacific railway, extending to the eastern line of the thirty acres that we purchased on the south side of the railway, was offered us for $750. This twenty-acre piece I urged one of our brethren to purchase and hold for us, but because of the criticisms and misgivings regarding what had already been done in securing the place, nothing was done.

We then obtained an option on the one hundred and fifty acres lying west of pepper drive, or than portion that remained unsold, at $250 an acre. While waiting for the general meeting to convene in may, the parties were about to back out on their option, so the local board took the matter under advisement and compromised by securing thirty-six acres of the property lying north of the railway, at $225 an acre, and purchased most of the acreage that had been sold off in front of this piece along pepper drive, paying $500 and $600 an acre for it. {SpTB17b 6.3}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　Early in 1911 the remainder of the kelly tract, comprising eighty-six acres lying west of pepper drive and south of colton avenue, was offered to us at $300 an acre.

Within a few days she returned, saying that her work at Loma Linda was not yet finished. Soon after her return she took up the matter of the purchase of the balance of the Kelly tract of eighty-six acres west of pepper drive. Three or four times she rode over and around the property, each time stating she had been instructed that we should secure the land adjoining the sanitarium, and urging that we ask the brethren to pray over the matter, so that we might have light to know what to do.

In place of the noble spirit of self-sacrifice that had filled the hearts of their illustrious ancestors, they cherished a spirit of covetousness, of grasping for more and more. They served heathen kings with their God-given skill, and dishonored their Maker. {SpTB19 6.1}"},{"t":7,"p":11,"c":"　　It was to these apostates that Solomon looked for a master workman to superintend the construction of the temple on Mount Moriah. Minute specifications, in writing, regarding every portion of the sacred structure, had been entrusted to the king, and he should have looked to God in faith for consecrated helpers, to whom would have been granted special skill for doing with exactness the work required. But Solomon lost sight of this opportunity to exercise faith in God. He sent to the king of Tyre for “a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men ... in Judah and in Jerusalem.” {SpTB19 6.2}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　The Phoenician king responded by sending Huram, “a cunning man, endued with understanding, ... the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre.” This master workman, Huram, was a descendant, on his mother’s side, of Aholiab, to whom hundreds of years before, God had given special wisdom for the construction of the tabernacle.

As they labored with him day after day, and yielded to the inclination to compare his wages with their own, they began to lose sight of the holy character of their work, and to dwell upon the difference between their wages and his.

The spirit of covetousness, of seeking for the highest position and the highest wage, is rife in the world. The old-time spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice is too seldom met. But this is the only spirit that can actuate a true follower of Jesus. Our divine Master has given us an example of how we are to work.

The workers are to humble their hearts before the Lord, acknowledging His sovereignty. All are to live in accordance with principles of self-denial. As the true, self-sacrificing laborer, with his spiritual lamp trimmed and burning, strives unselfishly to advance the interests of the institution in which he is working, he will have a precious experience, and will be able to say, “The Lord indeed is in this place.” He will feel that he is highly privileged in being permitted to give to the Lord’s institution his ability, his service, and his unwearying vigilance. {SpTB19 9.1}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　In the early days of the third angel’s message those who established our institutions, and those who labored in them, were actuated by high motives of unselfishness.

The reward of whole-souled liberality was apparent in their close fellowship with the Spirit of the Master Worker. They practised the closest economy, in order that as many other laborers as possible might be planting the standard of truth in new places. {SpTB19 9.2}"},{"t":7,"p":19,"c":"　　But in time a change came. The spirit of sacrifice was not so manifest. In some of our institutions the wages of a few workers was increased beyond reason. Those who received these wages claimed that they deserved a greater sum than others, because of their superior talents. But who gave them their talents, their ability? With the increase of wages came a steady increase of covetousness, which is idolatry, and a steady decline of spirituality. Gross evils crept in, and God was dishonored. The minds of many who witnessed this grasping after higher and still higher wages, were leavened with doubt and unbelief.

Many ceased to deny self, and not a few withheld their tithes and offerings. {SpTB19 10.1}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　God in His providence called for a reform in His sacred work, which should begin at the heart, and work outwardly.

So far as possible, they endeavored to set a right example before the people by voluntarily reducing their wages.
