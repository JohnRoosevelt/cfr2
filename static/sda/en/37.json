[{"n":"Foreword","ps":[{"t":2,"p":0,"c":"Foreword"},{"t":7,"p":1,"c":"　　In Ellen G. White’s lifetime (1827-1915) psychology, the science which treats of the mind and its powers and functions, was in its infancy. Yet there emerges throughout her writings a distinctive philosophy in which guidelines in this science and to mental health are clearly portrayed. {1MCP iii.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　The purpose of this compilation is to bring the Ellen G. White statements in this broad, important, and sometimes controversial field together for convenient study. Seventh-day Adventists and others with their conviction that Ellen G. White wrote under the influence of the spirit of God treasure guidance in a field so vital to all humanity at a time when schools of psychological thought are varied and changing. {1MCP iii.2}"},{"t":7,"p":3,"c":"　　The soundness of Ellen White’s views in the areas of physiology, nutrition, and education, as well as in other fields, has already been demonstrated. There is no doubt that as research in psychology and mental health progresses, her reputation for setting forth sound psychological principles will be still more firmly established. To the devout Adventist this work, Mind, Character, and Personality, will supply many answers. We are certain that as truth unfolds, the positions taken here will appeal more and more to all thoughtful readers. {1MCP iii.3}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　In these circumstances the occasional appearance of such expressions as “I saw,” “I was shown,” “I have been instructed,” are not only understood, but are welcomed for the assurance they give that the concepts portrayed originated with Him who shaped the human mind. {1MCP iii.4}"},{"t":7,"p":5,"c":"　　In assembling this material in the White Estate offices there has been no attempt to select passages that support views advocated by various authorities in the fields of education and psychology. No preconceived views held by the compilers are represented here. Rather, an effort has been made to allow Ellen White to freely propound her views. This has been accomplished by drawing from the vast store of her published writings, penned through six decades, as they appear in current or out-of-print books, pamphlets, her thousands of periodical articles, and in her voluminous manuscript and correspondence files housed in the White Estate vault. {1MCP iv.1}"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　A large portion of Mind, Character, and Personality presents general guiding principles. This is interspersed and supplemented with materials setting forth practical admonitions and counsels in the setting of the relationship of the teacher and the student, the minister and the parishioner, the physician and the patient, or the parent and the child. {1MCP iv.2}"},{"t":7,"p":7,"c":"　　The counsels in scores of instances addressed to an executive, minister, physician, teacher, editor, husband, housewife, or youth, may in their revelation of circumstances and advice given, partake somewhat of the form of case histories. Attention should be directed to the principle involved. {1MCP iv.3}"},{"t":7,"p":8,"c":"　　Obviously Ellen White did not write as a psychologist. She did not employ terminology in common usage in the field of psychology today. In fact, the reader must even approach her uses of the words “psychology”, “phrenology,” etc., with understanding. The knowledgeable reader, however, will be deeply impressed by her unusual insight into basic principles of psychology, which these writings evince. The Ellen G. White statements on the various aspects of the mind, its vital place in the human experience, its potentials, and the factors that lead to its optimum functioning as drawn together in a logical sequence yield a choice addition to the Ellen G. White books issued posthumously. These help us to comprehend what man is and to understand his relationship to his earthly environment, to God, and to the universe. {1MCP iv.4}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　Ten years ago, when work was begun on this compilation, it was thought that it would have its widest appeal to those studying particularly in the field of mental health. Hence, an arrangement has been followed that would make statements readily available to those considering classified areas. The researcher should understand that while an attempt has been made to avoid redundancy as much as possible, a few key statements are repeated in different chapters because the student would expect to find them under different appropriate headings. It is now clear that this compilation is of vital interest to all Adventists and to their friends as well, for all of us are involved in the battle for the mind. {1MCP iv.5}"},{"t":7,"p":10,"c":"　　The work of the compilers has been confined to the selection of the materials, placing these in what seemed to be a logical sequence, and supplying the headings, including the side headings that introduce the items chosen. An attempt has been made to include, on the subjects presented, all essential statements penned through the years of Ellen White’s active service, thus taking advantage of approaching a given point from all angles and presenting the widest possible coverage. In so doing there is here and there repetition of thought in general basic lines that the casual reader may find somewhat irritating. The careful student, however, will welcome each phrase that makes a contribution to the subject under discussion. Thus Mind, Character, and Personality is somewhat encyclopedic. {1MCP v.1}"},{"t":7,"p":11,"c":"　　Each quotation carries a specific credit to its source in the Ellen G. White materials, making it possible for the reader in many cases to turn to the full original context if desired. In the interest of conserving space, the commonly accepted abbreviations to the E. G. White writings are employed in the source references. A key to these abbreviations follows in the introductory pages. In all cases the date of writing or of first publication is supplied. The original sources are given as primary references, and if currently available in book form, the appropriate current published references appear. Credits to the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary are to the E. G. White supplementary statements appearing at the close of each of the Commentary Volumes, or in Volume 7a of the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary. {1MCP v.2}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　Limitation of space has precluded the inclusion in these volumes of some mind-related topics as “insanity”, etc., for which the reader is referred to the Comprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White. {1MCP v.3}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　This compilation has been prepared in the offices of the Ellen G. White Estate under the direction of the Board of Trustees as authorized by Ellen White in her will. Unlike most compilations of Ellen G. White materials it was first released in temporary form under the title of Guidelines to Mental Health, for classroom testing and for critical reading by Adventist educators, psychologists, and psychiatrists. It was the desire of the White Estate to make certain that all known statements relevant to the topics represented were taken into account and that the arrangement of materials was acceptable. {1MCP v.4}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　The favorable response from the classroom use and of others ensures the place of this work with the many other Ellen G. White books of posthumous publication. As now issued in two parts, it becomes a segment of the popular Christian Home Library. {1MCP vi.1}"},{"t":7,"p":15,"c":"　　In its present from it represents somewhat of a revision in the selection of items and an improvement in the order of their appearance. A chapter titled “Love and Sexuality in the Human Experience” has been added. Additions have rounded out certain chapters, and some deletions have eliminated unnecessary repetition. Paging is continuous through the two parts, and the scripture and subject indexes to the entire work are at the close. {1MCP vi.2}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　That the clearly traced picture of the great controversy between the forces of good and evil for the control of the human mind may warn and enlighten all readers and provide suggestions and direction for choosing that which will give safe guidance today and ensure a future inheritance in the life to come is the earnest hope of {1MCP vi.3}"},{"t":6,"p":16,"c":"The Board of Trustees of the Ellen G.

Often the training and education of a lifetime must be discarded that one may become a learner in the school of Christ. The heart must be educated to become steadfast in God.

It serves his purpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying wonders are more readily received.

Health of body depends largely upon health of soul; therefore whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God. Personal religion is revealed by the deportment, the words, and the actions.

As we contemplate the cross, we are enabled to see the wonderful provision it has brought to every believer. God in Christ, ... if seen aright, will level human exaltation and pride.

Separating himself in his egotism from God and his fellow beings, he follows his unrestrained inclinations.

It is because these evil agencies are striving to eclipse every ray of light from the soul that heavenly beings are appointed to do their work of ministry, to guide, guard, and control those who shall be heirs of salvation.

The heart that loves God supremely will not in any way be inclined to narrow down His precepts to the very smallest possible claims, but the obedient, loyal soul will cheerfully render full spiritual obedience when the law is seen in its spiritual power. Then will the commandments come home to the soul in their real force. Sin will appear exceedingly sinful.... There is no longer self-righteousness, self-esteem, self-honor. Self-security is gone.

I need forgiveness and pardon, and Christ says that if I come to Him I shall not perish.

They failed to keep God ever before them, they neglected prayer and cherished a spirit of self-confidence. Ease and self-indulgence left the citadel of the soul unguarded, and debasing thoughts found entrance. It was the traitors within the walls that overthrew the strongholds of principle and betrayed Israel into the power of Satan. {1MCP 75.1}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　It is thus that Satan still seeks to compass the ruin of the soul. A long preparatory process, unknown to the world, goes on in the heart before the Christian commits open sin.

He may be merciful to them while they indulge in this pernicious habit in ignorance of the injury it is doing them, but when the matter is set before them in its true light, then they are guilty before God if they continue to indulge this gross appetite.—Spiritual Gifts, 4a:126 (1864). {1MCP 75.4}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　Slaves to Alcohol and Drugs—On every side Satan seeks to entice the youth into the path of perdition; and if he can once get their feet set in the way, he hurries them on in their downward course, leading them from one dissipation to another, until his victims lose their tenderness of conscience and have no more the fear of God before their eyes. They exercise less and less self-restraint. They become addicted to the use of wine and alcohol, tobacco and opium, and go from one stage of debasement to another. They are slaves to appetite. Counsel which they once respected, they learn to despise. They put on swaggering airs and boast of liberty when they are the servants of corruption.

If the body is saturated with liquor and the defilement of tobacco, it is not holy and acceptable to God. Satan knows that it cannot be, and for this reason he brings his temptations to bear upon men upon the point of appetite, that he may bring them into bondage to this propensity and thus work their ruin.—The Review and Herald, September 8, 1874. {1MCP 76.2}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　The Deciding Factor of Passion and Appetite—If men and women of intelligence have their moral powers benumbed through intemperance of any kind, they are, in many of their habits, elevated but little above the heathen.

The great enemy knows that if appetite and passion predominate, health of body and strength of intellect are sacrificed upon the altar of self-gratification, and man is brought to speedy ruin. If enlightened intellect holds the reins, controlling the animal propensities, keeping them in subjection to the moral powers, Satan well knows that his power to overcome with his temptations is very small.—The Review and Herald, September 8, 1874.

God gives opportunities; success depends upon the use made of them.—Prophets and Kings, 486 (1917). {1MCP 100.1}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　Mental Culture Is What We Need—Mental culture is what we as a people need and what we must have in order to meet the demands of the time.

It was such men whom Jesus connected with Himself, and He gave them the advantages of three years’ training under His own care.

Self-discipline must be carried on by everyone who claims to be a child of God; for it is in this way that the mind and will are brought into subjection to the mind and will of God. Decided discipline in the cause of the Lord will accomplish more than eloquence and the most brilliant talents.

Your perceptive faculties will increase in power and soundness if your whole being—body, soul, and spirit—is consecrated to the accomplishment of a holy work. Make every effort, in and through the grace of Christ, to attain to the high standard set before you. You can be perfect in your sphere as God is perfect in His sphere.

The skin, too, becomes inactive. Impurities are not expelled as they would be if the circulation had been quickened by vigorous exercise, the skin kept in a healthy condition, and the lungs fed with plenty of pure, fresh air.

Conscientious actions are dependent on conscientious thinking. Exercise in agricultural pursuits and in the various branches of labor is a wonderful safeguard against undue brain taxation.

Were not the sins of the parents transmitted to the children in perverted appetites and passions? And was not the work completed by those who neglected to train them according to the pattern which God has given? Just as surely as they exist, all these parents will pass in review before God.—Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 76, 77, 1890.

The church needs all the cultivated spiritual force which can be obtained, that all, and especially the younger members of the Lord’s family, may be carefully guarded.

Always speak kindly, as if in the presence of Christ. Let there be no faultfinding, no accusing. Words of this kind wound and bruise the soul. It is natural for human beings to speak sharp words. Those who yield to this inclination open the door for Satan to enter their hearts and to make them quick to remember the mistakes and errors of others. Their failings are dwelt upon, their deficiencies noted, and words are spoken that cause a lack of confidence in one who is doing his best to fulfill his duty as a laborer together with God.

Among our own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is not regarded as it should be, as a privilege and blessing.

This is a powerful witness in favor of the truth. In whomsoever they may appear, vulgarity of language and of demeanor indicate a vitiated heart. Truth of heavenly origin never degrades the receiver, never makes him coarse or rough. Truth is softening and refining in its influence. When received into the heart, it makes the youth respectful and polite. Christian politeness is received only under the working of the Holy Spirit.

So it is in spiritual things. Satan is constantly seeking to produce effects by rude and violent thrusts, but Jesus found access to minds by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He disturbed as little as possible their accustomed train of thought, by abrupt actions or prescribed rules. He honored man with His confidence, and thus placed him on his honor. He introduced old truths in a new and precious light. Thus when only twelve years old He astonished the doctors of the law by His questions in the temple.—Manuscript 44, 1894.

Even amid the turbulence of angry enemies He was surrounded with an atmosphere of peace.

Had it not been for the sweet, sympathetic spirit that shone out in every look and word, He would not have attracted the large congregations that He did. The afflicted ones who came to Him felt that He linked His interest with theirs as a faithful and tender friend, and they desired to know more of the truths He taught. Heaven was brought near.

In His presence souls despised and fallen realized that they still were men, and they longed to prove themselves worthy of His regard.

They should not be led to feel that they cannot go out or come in without being watched. Suspicion demoralizes, producing the very evils it seeks to prevent. Instead of watching continually, as if suspecting evil, teachers who are in touch with their pupils will discern the workings of the restless mind and will set to work influences that will counteract evil.

He might display great liberality; but should he, from some other motive than genuine love, bestow all his goods to feed the poor, the act would not commend him to the favor of God.

Even if it were certain that one would never need to resort to manual labor for his support, still he should be taught to work.

Their minds should be trained to think, their memories taxed to remember their appointed work; and in the training to habits of usefulness in the home they are being educated in doing practical duties appropriate to their age. If children have proper home training, they will not be found upon the streets, receiving the haphazard education that so many receive.

Some need to discipline the mind by exercise. They should force it to think. While they depend upon someone to think for them, to solve their difficulties, and they refuse to tax the mind with thought, the inability to remember, to look ahead and discriminate, will continue.

Their minds are not at rest. Girls desire the society of boys, and boys that of the girls. Their deportment is not reserved and modest. They are bold and forward, and take indecent liberties. The habit of self-abuse has debased their minds and tainted their souls.

Each should acquire a knowledge of some branch of manual labor by which, if need be, he may obtain a livelihood. This is essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes of life, but from its bearing upon physical, mental, and moral development. Even if it were certain that one would never need to resort to manual labor for his support, still he should be taught to work. Without physical exercise, no one can have a sound constitution and vigorous health; and the discipline of well-regulated labor is no less essential to the securing of a strong and active mind and a noble character.—Patriarchs and Prophets, 601 (1890). {1MCP 287.2}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　Idleness Is a Sin—The idea that ignorance of useful employment is an essential characteristic of the true gentleman or lady is contrary to the design of God in the creation of man.

Children should be taught to have a part in domestic duties. They should be instructed how to help father and mother in the little things that they can do. Their minds should be trained to think, their memories taxed to remember their appointed work; and in the training to habits of usefulness in the home they are being educated in doing practical duties appropriate to their age. If children have proper home training, they will not be found upon the streets, receiving the haphazard education that so many receive.

Some need to discipline the mind by exercise. They should force it to think. While they depend upon someone to think for them, to solve their difficulties, and they refuse to tax the mind with thought, the inability to remember, to look ahead and discriminate, will continue.

Naturally enthusiastic and impressible, the young are quick to respond to suggestion. In planning for the culture of plants, let the teacher seek to awaken an interest in beautifying the school grounds and the schoolroom. A double benefit will result. That which the pupils seek to beautify they will be unwilling to have marred or defaced.

Satan has been making special efforts to lead them to find happiness in worldly amusements and to justify themselves by endeavoring to show that these amusements are harmless, innocent, and even important for health.

Children should be taught to respect experienced judgment and to be guided by their parents and teachers.

Such rules are indispensable to guard the youth from the danger of premature courtship and unwise marriage. Young people are sent to school by their parents to obtain an education, not to flirt with the opposite sex.

The age, the conditions, and the turn of mind must be taken into consideration. We must be wisely considerate in all our work.

As in your own case, blind impulse controls reason and judgment.

They take the first step in backsliding by venturing to disregard the Lord’s express command; and complete apostasy is too often the result. It has ever proved a dangerous thing for men to carry out their own will in opposition to the requirements of God. Yet it is a hard lesson for men to learn that God means what He says. As a rule, those who choose for their friends and companions, persons who reject Christ and trample upon God’s law eventually become of the same mind and spirit.—The Signs of the Times, May 19, 1881.

She has not been destitute of light; she has had religious privileges, and yet she has not felt her wretched sinfulness without Christ. If, in your infatuation, you can repeatedly turn from the prayer meeting—where God meets with His people—in order to enjoy the society of one who has no love for God and who sees no attractions in the religious life, how can you expect God to prosper such a union?—Testimonies for the Church 3:44 (1872). {1MCP 304.1}"},{"t":7,"p":34,"c":"　　Marriage of Christians With Unbelievers—There is in the Christian world an astonishing, alarming indifference to the teaching of God’s Word in regard to the marriage of Christians with unbelievers. Many who profess to love and fear God choose to follow the bent of their own minds rather than take counsel of Infinite Wisdom. In a matter which vitally concerns the happiness and well-being of both parties for this world and the next, reason, judgment, and the fear of God are set aside, and blind impulse, stubborn determination, is allowed to control. {1MCP 304.2}"},{"t":7,"p":35,"c":"　　Men and women who are otherwise sensible and conscientious close their ears to counsel; they are deaf to the appeals and entreaties of friends and kindred and of the servants of God.

He weaves his spell about the soul, and it becomes bewitched, infatuated. Reason lets fall the reins of self-control upon the neck of lust; unsanctified passion bears sway, until, too late, the victim awakens to a life of misery and bondage.

Until the Lord presented it to me, I knew not what to call it, but I was instructed to call it unholy spiritual love.—Testimonies for the Church 8:292 (1904). {1MCP 306.2}"},{"t":7,"p":42,"c":"　　Love Is Not Sentimentalism—The love and sympathy which Jesus would have us give to others does not savor of sentimentalism, which is a snare to the soul; it is a love that is of heavenly extraction, which Jesus exemplifies by both precept and example.

It would blot out the distinction between right and wrong, by agreeing with the transgressor instead of faithfully showing him his errors. Such a course never springs from real friendship.

He will abhor evil and cling to that which is good, at the sacrifice of association or friendship with the ungodly.

The power of self-control should then be acquired. By the fireside and at the family board, influences are exerted whose results are as enduring as eternity. More than any natural endowment, the habits established in early years decide whether a man will be victorious or vanquished in the battle of life. Youth is the sowing time.

This self-discipline is essential to that mental strength and spiritual insight which will enable us to understand and to practice the sacred truths of God’s Word.

John says, “I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one” (1 John 2:14). An elevated standard is presented before the youth, and God is inviting them to come into real service for Him. True-hearted young men who delight to be learners in the school of Christ can do a great work for the Master if they will only give heed to the command of the Captain as it sounds down along the lines to our time: “Quit you like men, be strong” (1 Corinthians 16:13).—The Review and Herald, June 16, 1891.

Those who are uneducated, untrained, and unrefined are not prepared to enter a field in which the powerful influences of talent and education combat the truths of God’s Word.

They did not feel that their educational advantages were of value to them, and so did not advance as they might have advanced in the knowledge of religion and science.

There is no virtue in ignorance, and knowledge will not necessarily dwarf Christian growth; but if you seek for it from principle, having the right object before you and feeling your obligation to God to use your faculties to do good to others and promote His glory, knowledge will aid you to accomplish this end; it will help you to bring into exercise the powers which God has given you and to employ them in His service.—Testimonies for the Church 3:223 (1872). {1MCP 310.1}"},{"t":7,"p":8,"c":"　　Choosing the Side of Unbelief—The word of God will judge every one of us at the last great day.

False science is a something independent of God. It is pretentious ignorance. This deceptive power has captivated and enslaved the minds of many, and they have chosen darkness rather than light. They have taken their position on the side of unbelief, as though it were a virtue and the sign of a great mind to doubt, when it is the sign of a mind too weak and narrow to perceive God in His created works. They could not fathom the mystery of His providence should they study with all their power for a lifetime. And because the works of God cannot be explained by finite minds, Satan brings his sophistry to bear upon them and entangles them in the meshes of unbelief.

If, in obtaining an education, you become so absorbed in your studies that you neglect prayer and religious privileges and become careless and indifferent to the welfare of your souls, if you cease to learn in the school of Christ, you are selling your birthright for a mess of pottage. The object for which you are obtaining an education should not be lost sight of for a moment. It should be to so develop and direct your faculties that you may be more useful and bless others to the extent of your ability. {1MCP 311.3}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　If by obtaining knowledge you increase your love of yourselves and your inclination to excuse yourselves from bearing responsibilities, you are better without an education.

The physical inaction which seems almost inevitable in the schoolroom—together with other unhealthful conditions—makes it a trying place for children, especially for those of feeble constitution....No wonder that in the schoolroom the foundation of lifelong illness is so often laid. The brain, the most delicate of all the physical organs, and that from which the nervous energy of the whole system is derived, suffers the greatest injury.

They have not learned to take up the duties and bear the home responsibilities which it is their duty to bear. They have a faithful, practical mother, who has borne many burdens which her children should not have suffered her to bear. In this they have failed to honor their mother. They have not shared the burdens of their father as was their duty, and have neglected to honor him as they should. They follow inclination rather than duty. {1MCP 312.3}"},{"t":7,"p":16,"c":"　　They have pursued a selfish course in their lives, in shunning burdens and toil, and have failed to obtain a valuable experience which they cannot afford to be deprived of if they would make life a success.

Recreation, when true to its name, re-creation, tends to strengthen and build up. Calling us aside from our ordinary cares and occupations, it affords refreshment for mind and body, and thus enables us to return with new vigor to the earnest work of life. Amusement, on the other hand, is sought for the sake of pleasure and is often carried to excess; it absorbs the energies that are required for useful work and thus proves a hindrance to life’s true success.—Education, 207 (1903). {1MCP 313.2}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　Senseless Mirth—Our recreations should not be scenes of senseless mirth, taking the form of the nonsensical.

Amusements that have a tendency to weaken the love for sacred things and lessen our joy in the service of God are not to be sought by Christians.

The truth is to go to the remotest bounds of the earth, through agents trained for the work. But while the knowledge of science is a power, the knowledge which Jesus in person came to impart to the world was the knowledge of the gospel. The light of truth was to flash its bright rays into the uttermost parts of the earth, and the acceptance or rejection of the message of God involved the eternal destiny of souls.—The Review and Herald, December 1, 1891.

The great object to be secured should be the proper development of character, that the individual may be fitted rightly to discharge the duties of the present life and to enter at last upon the future, immortal life. Eternity will reveal the manner in which the work has been performed. If ministers and teachers could have a full sense of their responsibility, we should see a different state of things in the world today. But they are too narrow in their views and purposes.

Few have sufficient courage and self-control to act from principle. Most students fail to understand the true object of education, and hence fail to take such a course as to secure this object. They apply themselves to the study of mathematics or the languages, while they neglect a study far more essential to the happiness and success of life. Many who can explore the depths of the earth with the geologist or traverse the heavens with the astronomer show not the slightest interest in the wonderful mechanism of their own bodies. Others can tell just how many bones there are in the human frame and correctly describe every organ of the body, and yet they are as ignorant of the laws of health and the cure of disease as though life were controlled by blind fate instead of definite and unvarying law.—The Signs of the Times, June 29, 1882.

The energies that should have been devoted to business of various lines have been neglected. Education does not consist in using the brain alone. Physical employment is a part of the training essential for every youth.

This has sometimes led to the opinion that if the intellect is educated to put forth its highest powers, it will strengthen the physical and moral nature for the development of the whole man. Time and experience have proved this to be an error. We have seen men and women go forth as graduates from college who were in no way qualified to make a proper use of the wonderful physical organism with which God had provided them. The whole body is designed for action, not for inaction. {1MCP 363.2}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　If the physical powers are not taxed equally with the mental, too much strain is brought upon the latter. Unless every part of the human machinery performs its allotted tasks, the mental powers cannot be used to their highest capability for any length of time. Natural powers must be governed by natural laws, and the faculties must be educated to work harmoniously and in accord with these laws. The teachers in our schools can disregard none of these particulars without shirking responsibility. Pride may lead them to seek for a high worldly standard of intellectual attainment that students may make a brilliant show; but when it comes to solid acquirements—those which are essential to fit men and women for any and every emergency in practical life—such students are only partially prepared to make life a success. Their defective education often leads to failure in whatever branch of business they undertake.—Testimonies for the Church 5:522 (1889). {1MCP 364.1}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　Not to Escape Life’s Burdens—Let the youth be impressed with the thought that education is not to teach them how to escape life’s disagreeable tasks and heavy burdens; that its purpose is to lighten the work by teaching better methods and higher aims.

We are not to do brain work and stop there, or make physical exertion and stop there; we are to make the best use of the various parts that compose the human machinery—brain, bone, muscle, head, and heart.—The Youth’s Instructor, April 7, 1898. (Sons and Daughters of God, 171). {1MCP 364.3}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　Ignorance Does Not Increase Spirituality—Young men should not enter upon the work of explaining the Scriptures and lecturing upon the prophecies when they do not have a knowledge of the important Bible truths they try to explain to others. They may be deficient in the common branches of education and therefore fail to do the amount of good they could do if they had had the advantages of a good school. Ignorance will not increase the humility or spirituality of any professed follower of Christ. The truths of the Divine Word can be best appreciated by an intellectual Christian. Christ can be best glorified by those who serve Him intelligently. The great object of education is to enable us to use the powers which God has given us in such a manner as will best represent the religion of the Bible and promote the glory of God.—Testimonies for the Church 3:160 (1872). {1MCP 364.4}"},{"t":7,"p":21,"c":"　　Education Requires Painstaking Efforts—Teachers should lead students to think and clearly to understand the truth for themselves. It is not enough for the teacher to explain or for the student to believe; inquiry must be awakened, and the student must be drawn out to state the truth in his own language, thus making it evident that he sees its force and makes the application. By painstaking effort the vital truths should thus be impressed upon the mind. This may be a slow process, but it is of more value than rushing over important subjects without due consideration. God expects His institutions to excel those of the world, for they are His representatives. Men truly connected with God will show to the world that a more than human agent is standing at the helm.—Testimonies for the Church 6:154 (1900). {1MCP 365.1}"},{"t":7,"p":22,"c":"　　Set Up Well-defined Landmarks—Let the youth set up well-defined landmarks by which they may be guided in emergencies. When a crisis comes that demands active, well-developed physical powers and a clear, strong, practical working mind; when difficult work is to be done where every stroke must tell, and perplexities can be met only through seeking wisdom from God, then the youth who have learned to overcome difficulties by earnest labor can respond to the call for workers, “Here am I, send me.” Let the hearts of young men and young women be as clear as crystal. Let not their thoughts be trivial, but sanctified by virtue and holiness. They need not be otherwise.

Instead of incurring debts or depending on the self-denial of their parents, let young men and young women depend on themselves. They will thus learn the value of money, the value of time, strength, and opportunities, and will be under far less temptation to indulge idle and spendthrift habits. The lessons of economy, industry, self-denial, practical business management, and steadfastness of purpose, thus mastered, would prove a most important part of their equipment for the battle of life. And the lesson of self-help learned by the student would go far toward preserving institutions of learning from the burden of debt under which so many schools have struggled and which has done so much toward crippling their usefulness.—Education, 221 (1903). {1MCP 366.4}"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　Education Molds Social Fabric—Throughout the world, society is in disorder, and a thorough transformation is needed.

And as they learn, let them impart their knowledge. It is thus that their minds will acquire discipline and power. It is the use they make of knowledge that determines the value of their education. To spend a long time in study, with no effort to impart what is gained, often proves a hindrance rather than a help to real development. In both the home and the school it should be the student’s effort to learn how to study and how to impart the knowledge gained.

The use of stimulating and indigestible food is often equally injurious to health and in many cases sows the seeds of drunkenness. True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything hurtful and to use judiciously that which is healthful. There are few who realize as they should how much their habits of diet have to do with their health, their character, their usefulness in this world, and their eternal destiny.

The tendencies of the physical nature, unless under the dominion of a higher power, will surely work ruin and death. The body is to be brought into subjection to the higher powers of the being.

For all the objects of His creation the condition is the same—a life sustained by receiving the life of God, a life exercised in harmony with the Creator’s will. To transgress His law—physical, mental, or moral—is to place oneself out of harmony with the universe, to introduce discord, anarchy, ruin.—Education, 99, 100 (1903). {2MCP 416.2}"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　Effect Follows Cause With Certainty—By the laws of God in nature, effect follows cause with unvarying certainty. The reaping testifies to the sowing. Here no pretense is tolerated. Men may deceive their fellowmen and may receive praise and compensation for service which they have not rendered.

But not so; he is cheating himself.

The mind gradually adapts itself to the subjects upon which it is allowed to dwell. It becomes assimilated to that which it is accustomed to love and reverence. Man will never rise higher than his standard of purity or goodness or truth. If self is his loftiest ideal, he will never attain to anything more exalted. Rather, he will constantly sink lower and lower. The grace of God alone has power to exalt man.

I have known parents to say, You cannot have this or that, and then relent, thinking that they may be too strict, and give the child the very thing they at first refused. A lifelong injury is thus inflicted. It is an important law of the mind—one which should not be overlooked—that when a desired object is so firmly denied as to remove all hope, the mind will soon cease to long for it and will be occupied in other pursuits. But as long as there is any hope of gaining the desired object, an effort will be made to obtain it.—The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.

The ideas and convictions of the individual mind will seek for expression. Whoever cherishes unbelief and criticism, whoever feels capable of judging the work of the Holy Spirit, will diffuse the spirit by which he is animated. It is the nature of unbelief and infidelity and resistance of the grace of God to make themselves felt and heard. The mind actuated by these principles is always striving to make a place for itself and obtain adherents. All who walk by the side of an apostate will be imbued by his spirit to share with others their thoughts and the result of their own inquiries, and the feelings which prompted their action; for it is not an easy matter to repress the principles upon which we act.—Special Testimonies, Series A 6:39, July 6, 1896.

No tongue can express, no finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating the goodness and love of God.

We cannot change our hearts, we cannot control our thoughts, our impulses, our affections. We cannot make ourselves pure, fit for God’s service. But we can choose to serve God, we can give Him our will; then He will work in us to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus our whole nature will be brought under the control of Christ.—The Ministry of Healing, 176 (1905). {2MCP 420.1}"},{"t":7,"p":20,"c":"　　The tempter can never compel us to do evil. He cannot control minds unless they are yielded to his control. The will must consent, faith must let go its hold upon Christ, before Satan can exercise his power upon us.

They do not see that to deprive man of the freedom of choice would be to rob him of his prerogative as an intelligent being and make him a mere automaton. It is not God’s purpose to coerce the will.

Like the inhabitants of all other worlds, he must be subjected to the test of obedience; but he is never brought into such a position that yielding to evil becomes a matter of necessity. No temptation or trial is permitted to come to him which he is unable to resist.

Their work may not show to the very best advantage to careless observers, and their labors may not be valued as highly as are those of the teacher who holds the minds and wills of his scholars by absolute authority; but the future lives of the pupils will show the fruits of the better plan of education.—Testimonies for the Church 3:134 (1872). {2MCP 421.3}"},{"t":7,"p":25,"c":"　　Uncontrolled Mind Becomes Weak—The mental powers should be developed to the utmost; they should be strengthened and ennobled by dwelling upon spiritual truths.

Some truths appeal much more strongly to the minds of one class of persons than to others; some points appear to be much more important to some than to others. The same principle applies to speakers.

Then your daughter’s death was indeed a sad blow, but others have passed through the same under more trying circumstances.

Such ones are a living proof of the tender care of God, who makes the darkness as well as the light, and chastens us for our good. Christ is the light of the world; in Him is no darkness.

Nowhere is obedience to these laws more important than in the sickroom. Nowhere does so much depend upon faithfulness in little things on the part of the attendants. In cases of serious illness, a little neglect, a slight inattention to a patient’s special needs or dangers, the manifestation of fear, excitement, or petulance, even a lack of sympathy, may turn the scale that is balancing life and death and cause to go down to the grave a patient who otherwise might have recovered.—The Ministry of Healing, 219 (1905). {2MCP 477.2}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　Fear Grieves the Holy Spirit—Faith takes God at His word, not asking to understand the meaning of the trying experiences that come. But there are many who have little faith. They are always fearing and borrowing trouble. Every day they are surrounded by the tokens of God’s love, every day they enjoy the bounties of His providence; but they overlook these blessings. And the difficulties they encounter, instead of driving them to God, separate them from Him, by arousing unrest and repining.... Jesus is their Friend. All heaven is interested in their welfare, and their fear and repining grieve the Holy Spirit. Not because we see or feel that God hears us are we to believe. We are to trust His promises. When we come to Him in faith, we should believe that every petition enters into the heart of Christ. When we have asked for His blessing, we should believe that we receive it, and thank Him that we have it. Then we are to go about our duties, assured that the blessing will be sent when we need it most. When we have learned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are answered. God will do for us “exceeding abundantly,” “according to the riches of His glory” and “the working of His mighty power.”—Gospel Workers, 261, 262 (1915). {2MCP 477.3}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　Freedom From Guilt Brings Freedom From Fear—Aaron as well as the people shrank away from Moses, and “they were afraid to come nigh him.” Seeing their confusion and terror, but ignorant of the cause, he urged them to come near. He held out to them the pledge of God’s reconciliation and assured them of His restored favor. They perceived in his voice nothing but love and entreaty, and at last one ventured to approach him. Too awed to speak, he silently pointed to the countenance of Moses, and then toward heaven. The great leader understood his meaning. In their conscious guilt, feeling themselves still under the divine displeasure, they could not endure the heavenly light, which, had they been obedient to God, would have filled them with joy.

His prayer for His disciples was, “I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.” “In the world,” He says, “ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 17:15; 16:33).—Steps to Christ, 122, 123 (1892). {2MCP 479.2}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　Look Away From Self—Look away from yourself to Jesus.

The sacrifices which we must make in following Christ are only so many steps to return to the path of light, of peace and happiness. Doubts and fears grow by indulgence, and the more they are indulged, the harder they are to overcome.

Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the universe. Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for Him to unravel. No calamity can befall the least of His children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer, no sincere prayer escape the lips, of which our heavenly Father is unobservant, or in which He takes no immediate interest....

In His dying agony, as He yields up His precious life, He has by faith alone to trust in Him whom it has ever been His joy to obey. He is not cheered with clear, bright rays of hope on the right hand or on the left. All is enshrouded in oppressive gloom.

Your feelings might not always be of a joyous nature; clouds would at times shadow the horizon of your experience; but the Christian’s hope does not rest upon the sandy foundation of feeling.

The believer commits his soul and body to God and with assurance may say, Christ is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.

Thus, instead of our own, it leads us to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His ownership and accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, have been pointed out as secrets of life’s success.

The unbelief that demands perfect knowledge will never yield to the evidence that God is pleased to give. He requires of His people faith that rests upon the weight of evidence, not upon perfect knowledge. Those followers of Christ who accept the light that God sends them must obey the voice of God speaking to them when there are many other voices crying out against it.

We should go forward as if to every prayer that we send to the throne of God we heard the response from the One whose promises never fail.

But that battle left its impression on the tender mind of the child, and it could not be easily effaced. I said to the mother, “You have deeply wronged your child.

An influence of which they are unconscious works upon the soul, and the conscience is quickened and the outward life is amended.

There are today thousands suffering from physical disease who, like the paralytic, are longing for the message, “Thy sins are forgiven.” The burden of sin, with its unrest and unsatisfied desires, is the foundation of their maladies.

Children who are thus educated will ever be deficient in moral energy and individual responsibility. They have not been taught to move from reason and principle; their wills have been controlled by another, and the mind has not been called out that it might expand and strengthen by exercise.

Persons of this character will make an effort to break a boy’s will, if he is unruly; but Christ has authorized no such manner of dealing with the erring.

These things must be brought into daily experience; there must be strict watchfulness and unwearied entreaty that Christ will bring every thought into captivity to Himself; His renovating power must be given to the soul, that as accountable beings we may present to God our bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto Him, which is our reasonable service.—Medical Missionary, November-December, 1892.

His servants today would do well to ask themselves, “What kind of will am I individually cultivating?

We are all building for eternity. Let the character have the impress of the divine in pure, noble utterances, in upright deeds.

It is not for us to shape our future. “By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went” (Hebrews 11:8). {2MCP 733.5}"},{"t":7,"p":14,"c":"　　Christ in His life on earth made no plans for Himself.

While we offer prayer for these sorrowful ones, we should encourage them to try to help those more needy than themselves.

He may have been overcome again and again, but it need not be always thus. He is weak in moral power, controlled by the habits of a life of sin. His promises and resolutions are like ropes of sand. The knowledge of his broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens his confidence in his own sincerity and causes him to feel that God cannot accept him or work with his efforts.

If the abiding principle is not in the heart, the mind will be molded after the deceiving similitude of Satan’s mind, working his will to the ruin of the soul.

Remember that however trying the circumstances in which a man may be placed, nothing can really weaken his soul so long as he does not yield to temptation but maintains his own integrity. The interests most vital to you individually are in your own keeping. No one can damage them without your consent. All the satanic legions cannot injure you unless you open your soul to the arts and arrows of Satan. Your ruin can never take place until your will consents.

In the hope of the glory of God we know that tribulation worketh patience and experience hope. What does it mean? If we do not feel just as we want to, are we to fly into impatience, speaking those words that show that we have the attributes of Satan? We cannot afford to speak a harsh word or an unkind word, because we are standing right in view of the heavenly intelligences and we are fighting the battle with all the heavenly universe looking upon us; and how we grieve the heart of God when we deny Him in any way!

He must give as well as receive. Our graces are increased by exercise. Christian society will furnish us with pure air to breathe, and in breathing it we must be active. The Christian work performed, the sympathies, encouragements, and instructions given by us to those who need them, the self-restraint, love, patience, and forbearance which are needed, exercised in Christian work, will create in ourselves faith, obedience, hope, and love to God.... {2MCP 804.3}"},{"t":7,"p":32,"c":"　　It is essential for spiritual muscle and strength that the soul have exercise.

Every man or woman who has received the divine illumination is to shed light on the dark pathway of those who are unacquainted with the better way. Social power, sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, must be improved in bringing souls to the Saviour. Christ is not to be hid away in the heart as a coveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely by the possessor.

The touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse those dormant faculties. It was such men that Jesus called to be His colaborers, and He gave them the advantage of association with Himself. Never had the world’s great men such a teacher. When the disciples came forth from the Saviour’s training, they were no longer ignorant and uncultured.
