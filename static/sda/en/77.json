At the same time, it has helped those with a burden for city evangelism to consider how best to be in the world but not of the world. {CL 3.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　With the end of time approaching, this instruction is more relevant than ever.

In choosing their surroundings, few make their spiritual prosperity the first consideration. {CL 5.1}"},{"t":7,"p":2,"c":"　　Parents flock with their families to the cities, because they fancy it easier to obtain a livelihood there than in the country. The children, having nothing to do when not in school, obtain a street education. From evil associates, they acquire habits of vice and dissipation. The parents see all this, but it will require a sacrifice to correct their error, and they stay where they are, until Satan gains full control of their children. {CL 5.2}"},{"t":7,"p":3,"c":"　　Better sacrifice any and every worldly consideration than to imperil the precious souls committed to your care. They will be assailed by temptations, and should be taught to meet them; but it is your duty to cut off every influence, to break up every habit, to sunder every tie, that keeps you from the most free, open, and hearty committal of yourselves and your family to God. {CL 5.3}"},{"t":7,"p":4,"c":"　　Instead of the crowded city, seek some retired situation where your children will be, so far as possible, shielded from temptation, and there train and educate them for usefulness. The prophet Ezekiel thus enumerates the causes that led to Sodom’s sin and destruction: “Pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hands of the poor and needy.” All who would escape the doom of Sodom, must shun the course that brought God’s judgments upon that wicked city.—Testimonies for the Church 5:232, 233 (1882). {CL 5.4}"},{"t":4,"p":4,"c":"City Living Not God’s Plan"},{"t":7,"p":5,"c":"　　The world over, cities are becoming hotbeds of vice.

Every day brings the record of violence,—robberies, murders, suicides, and crimes unnamable. {CL 5.5}"},{"t":7,"p":6,"c":"　　Life in the cities is false and artificial. The intense passion for money getting, the whirl of excitement and pleasure seeking, the thirst for display, the luxury and extravagance, all are forces that, with the great masses of mankind, are turning the mind from life’s true purpose. They are opening the door to a thousand evils. Upon the youth they have almost irresistible power. {CL 6.1}"},{"t":7,"p":7,"c":"　　One of the most subtle and dangerous temptations that assails the children and youth in the cities is the love of pleasure. Holidays are numerous; games and horse racing draw thousands, and the whirl of excitement and pleasure attracts them away from the sober duties of life. Money that should have been saved for better uses is frittered away for amusements. {CL 6.2}"},{"t":7,"p":8,"c":"　　Through the working of trusts, and the results of labor unions and strikes the conditions of life in the city are constantly becoming more and more difficult. Serious troubles are before us; and for many families removal from the cities will become a necessity. {CL 6.3}"},{"t":7,"p":9,"c":"　　The physical surroundings in the cities are often a peril to health. The constant liability to contact with disease, the prevalence of foul air, impure water, impure food, the crowded, dark, unhealthful dwellings, are some of the many evils to be met. {CL 6.4}"},{"t":7,"p":10,"c":"　　It was not God’s purpose that people should be crowded into cities, huddled together in terraces and tenements. In the beginning He placed our first parents amidst the beautiful sights and sounds He desires us to rejoice in today.

Some were loitering, making no determined efforts. {CL 6.6}"},{"t":7,"p":12,"c":"　　The angels of mercy hurried Lot and his wife and daughters by taking hold of their hands. Had Lot hastened as the Lord desired him to, his wife would not have become a pillar of salt. Lot had too much of a lingering spirit. Let us not be like him. The same voice that warned Lot to leave Sodom bids us, “Come out from among them, and be ye separate, ... and touch not the unclean.” Those who obey this warning will find a refuge. Let every man be wide awake for himself, and try to save his family. Let him gird himself for the work. God will reveal from point to point what to do next. {CL 6.7}"},{"t":7,"p":13,"c":"　　Hear the voice of God through the apostle Paul: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.” Lot trod the plain with unwilling and tardy steps.

All the accumulated riches will be as nothingness.... {CL 7.4}"},{"t":7,"p":17,"c":"　　Calamities will come—calamities most awful, most unexpected; and these destructions will follow one after another. If there will be a heeding of the warnings that God has given, and if churches will repent, returning to their allegiance, then other cities may be spared for a time. But if men who have been deceived continue in the same way in which they have been walking, disregarding the law of God, and presenting falsehoods before the people, God allows them to suffer calamity, that their senses may be awakened. {CL 7.5}"},{"t":7,"p":18,"c":"　　The Lord will not suddenly cast off all transgressors, or destroy entire nations; but He will punish cities and places where men have given themselves up to the possession of Satanic agencies. Strictly will the cities of the nations be dealt with, and yet they will not be visited in the extreme of God’s indignation, because some souls will yet break away from the delusions of the enemy, and will repent and be converted, while the mass will be treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath.—Evangelism, 27 (1906). {CL 8.1}"},{"t":4,"p":18,"c":"Imminence of God’s Judgments"},{"t":7,"p":19,"c":"　　There are reasons why we should not build in the cities.

I seemed to awake from sleep, but was not in my home. From the windows I could behold a terrible conflagration. Great balls of fire were falling upon houses, and from these balls fiery arrows were flying in every direction. It was impossible to check the fires that were kindled, and many places were being destroyed.

During a vision of the night, I stood on an eminence, from which I could see houses shaken like a reed in the wind. Buildings, great and small, were falling to the ground. Pleasure resorts, theaters, hotels, and the homes of the wealthy were shaken and shattered. Many lives were blotted out of existence, and the air was filled with the shrieks of the injured and the terrified. {CL 8.6}"},{"t":7,"p":24,"c":"　　The destroying angels of God were at work. One touch, and buildings so thoroughly constructed that men regarded them as secure against every danger, quickly became heaps of rubbish. There was no assurance of safety in any place.

The angel that stood by my side declared that God’s supreme rulership, and the sacredness of His law, must be revealed to those who persistently refuse to render obedience to the King of kings. Those who choose to remain disloyal, must be visited in mercy with judgments, in order that, if possible, they may be aroused to a realization of the sinfulness of their course.—Testimonies for the Church 9:92, 93 (1909) . {CL 9.3}"},{"t":4,"p":26,"c":"Peril to Those Who Remain Unnecessarily"},{"t":7,"p":27,"c":"　　In harmony with the light given me, I am urging people to come out from the great centers of population.

All that Lot and his family did in Sodom could have been done by them, even if they had lived in a place some distance away from the city.

The Lord desires that we shall have clear spiritual eyesight. We must be quick to discern the peril that would attend the establishment of institutions in these wicked cities.

It will then be time to leave the large cities, preparatory to leaving the smaller ones for retired homes in secluded places among the mountains. And now, instead of seeking expensive dwellings here, we should be preparing to move to a better country, even a heavenly.
